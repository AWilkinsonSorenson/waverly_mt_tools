A Republican strategy to impede Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers this latter a myth and asserts that voter fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from being struck by lightning.
en: In fact, Republican lawyers have found only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new regulations will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
In line with this, most American governments passed new laws from 2009 onwards making it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, in 2011, 180 bills were introduced that restricted the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
en: Furthermore, those laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and remove the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to require it.
The United States Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
Therefore, Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bill proposals in 34 states to require voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal form of identification, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any form of government-issued photo ID in their state.
English: On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identification document with those characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required identification document costs more than one hundred dollars.
Therefore, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and those with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 years old, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who most vote for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
Furthermore, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who typically vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
en Arizona was the first state to implement such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are US citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit Hispanic voting.
It appears that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished same-day voter registration in eight states.
en: Furthermore, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create an assistance service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
Additionally, Republican legislators passed laws in five other states that favored reducing the early voting period.
In the 2008 elections in Florida, for example, 33% of early voters were African American, while they only represented 13% of the state's electorate.
Spanish: En el caso de los hispanos, ocurría exactamente lo mismo.
These represent only 11% of the voters, which amounts to 24% of the citizens who vote early.
However, whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, only represent 46% of the citizens who voted early.
English: Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several pieces of legislation.
The United States Department of Justice intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, to some extent, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these system-wide legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new regulations will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Should I Get Tested or Not?
Indeed, the PSA test can sometimes produce inaccurate results, with false negatives or even false positives, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reticent by nature, doubt whether they should or should not take the screening tests.
Should I take the test or not?
We have sought advice from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of infection was detected among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
en: The European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had undergone screening and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up of 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastasis if the screening test has not been done.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
African American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. All possible options should be offered and prostate cancers that do not pose a long-term threat to life should not necessarily be treated, in which case active surveillance of the disease should be chosen instead.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since the cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their life.
We suggest active monitoring of the disease instead, and if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine if you should get the test or not.
Movember has collaborated with the International Society of Urology to create a tool that allows for evaluating the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of getting the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
English: "If nobody smoked, that rate would at least increase by 50%,” emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
We estimate that around 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It hugely harms people's health.
en: Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec, said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
An encouraging statistic: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Obesity and being overweight also increase the risk of disease, according to the SCC.
The risks of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancer are increasing.
en: Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer, they add.
Food
The organism recommends limiting the consumption of red meats as well.
In large amounts, they increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Deli meats should also be avoided.
Meat preservation for smoking, drying, or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
They explain to us that it can damage the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
According to the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them showed a decrease in prostate cancer risks, the other one showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been able to be determined clearly.
en: Furthermore, M. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of discussing one's worries and family background with their doctor.
Taking the screening test does not cause cancer.
The Higgs Boson in Detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a great stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model: our best or "least bad" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter, which has yet to be empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Additionally, new data revealed this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is needed to be completely sure.
en: We assume it is Higgs anyway, since the chances of being wrong seem slim. We will see what it is about.
Hey, in this great world, there is a widespread and unavoidable law that implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you will end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of this kind in it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
en: On one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And then there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, meaning they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Lab's Particle Adventure website, which is quite extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't discuss here, and the "force particles" through which the fundamental forces of nature are propagated and with which the Higgs boson is somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic creatures we might think.
Indeed, if you are able to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" which acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that immediate environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing other than a photon; that is, one of the bosons "force carriers".
Stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, extremely high energies are required, a bit like a frozen pond in which only a large rock could slide across the surface.
Therefore, an immense particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circumference ring!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never stay stuck to the door of a fridge by itself.
In the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what can all these researches contribute?, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and SM predictions.
English: Meanwhile, many fervently wish that they will be found, as the smallest difference could open a door to a “new physics” that could patch up certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as not proposing any explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up around 80% of the matter in the Universe (another oops!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Consequences
The repercussions of such investigations on our daily lives are hard to predict, but we don't think we're wrong when we say there will be none.
To see: In the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would cause.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
Indeed, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was more of a "laboratory device".
Imagine...
And also, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light sensor in 1969 as part of his research in optics.
Despite it not being his original intention, this sensor now serves as the "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.

en: Palliative Care. The Best Way to Die... | Le Devoir
In its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
The Duty has tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Cancer of the prostate that was destroying him had given him a reprieve of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, but I've already been like this for seven," he recounts, withered away, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived at the day before.
en: "But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she continues.
The illness has wreaked havoc on him: a tremendous weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating by himself.
Sitting in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly accepts help to eat.
Brave, she even smiles, talks to strangers who pay her attention, bring her medicine and offer her a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
en: "My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confesses.
Later that day, the team found a remedy for the problem.
In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up,” relates Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
To go back to one's childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
en: "That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provide "curative" care.
Mrs. A.'s greatest fear, at 89 years old, is to die "conscious and suffocating".
But the illness has made him discover his children.
en: "I have good children," he adds.
She says, "I have no more wishes in this life," before accepting the mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the coming days, for one last visit from her son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois is offering, with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance with meals.
Palliative care is given when nothing else can be done.
To help make her passing more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all eventually die one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether it be on a physical, emotional, or spiritual level.
The dying are offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics are no longer monitored for their blood sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who passed away during the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
en: "We help both patients and their loved ones," reports Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
In Victor-Gadbois Center, days pass without ever being the same.
Beside a 94-year-old man savoring his last family gathering in the yard, comfortably nestled among his pillows while everyone toasts to his health, a 36-year-old tragically passes away surrounded by his parents, wife, and two children, having tried everything to survive.
For the past six months, there have been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years old suffering from cancer, worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois center come from their home and 47% come from the hospital.
Access to Palliative Care Problem
Seventy-seven percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to relieve suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital, or in a care facility.
Several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
The lack of adequate healthcare in Quebec is precisely what has many specialized palliative care doctors fearing the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care luminaries such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthcare system in Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has access to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the Emergency Room suffering from severe pain without anything being done to relieve her.
I fear that patients wish to die alone because they are not receiving the proper care.
At the same time, many oncologists remain dedicated to their patients until the very end, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already at a minimum when she stopped an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to give up fighting, he recounts.
en: However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!
There are no all-powerful caretakers.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die are thankful to their caregivers for not having responded to their requests once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of their death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, untreated illness will have the possibility of having palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible through a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Wide-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fundraisers, and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, unionists, and mafiosos.
en: An "industry" that became too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system crumbles once we've caught the big guys," quips Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outburst of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible through an in-depth investigation into the misappropriations linked to highway contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, the clandestine financing of political parties, and corruption among officials.
From the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transportation would have saved one billion dollars in contracts, containing some of its instincts to take a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," it adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the stratagems existing behind the individuals".
An anti-corruption permanent unit, established in 2011.
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, established in 2011, is also applied with its team of government auditors, investigators, and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "Squad Marteau", which, since 2009, have made the "Sewer Cartel" of Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
Over the past few weeks, the unit has been carrying out a series of investigations into fraud and corruption allegations against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a town on the outskirts.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who recently resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
It is suspected that multiple bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of Montreal's road network and Italian-origin businessmen, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
This last one has caused shock when explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal for three years to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money left and right during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the ruling Liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising campaign for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewer contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption operated effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: over a ten-year period he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction sector companies totaling $736,000, all in exchange for contracts for sewerage work whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices by between 30% and 40% for false extras.
Additionally, an organizer of the Mayor Martin Dumont's party accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, leading Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
Seventy percent of the money for election campaigns was dirty money.
From the research that will eventually be carried out, she ensures that she will "pull a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish out the culprits".
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning up the wounds but there is a need for a clean investigative unit in Montreal and to be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat.
How to do the cleaning.
Spanish: Regularmente.
Jacques Duchesneau stated that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is most concerned about the role of the "elected politicians aware of the scheme".
English: Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was used to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I have been told that this is only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit political party donations to $100, but that won't change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
Recommend a full review of the public contract awarding and party funding system: "We cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
en: "PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has taken on a new identity with PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I move forward day by day by your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
Those elements push me to raise the level of my game every day.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything moves very fast in football.
But I don't get worked up.
Since my start at INF Clairefontaine's training center to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have made giant strides.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruits of this summer are used to playing high-level games.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it my all.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti has been very helpful in terms of my positioning.
He is backed up by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man that the team needed?
en: Of course.
All coaches respect Ancelotti.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great deal of experience and has won numerous titles with the top clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think she will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The trust he has in me explains my good performance as well.
What do you think about PSG in the first half of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken away our top spot.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say against many and very good European teams.
We want, to start off, to finish first in our league against Porto in order to receive the return of the eighth-finals.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and be there for the long haul.
Today, that is not the case.
Economically, PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Would not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, be a huge failure?
en: Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that championship title.
We didn't get very far in the last season.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal for them to expect a lot from us if we consider what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home against Troyes, it is a bit frustrating that there are still things to be criticized.
We wonder what else people are expecting.
We will never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to get a game project off the ground.
Building a team takes time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, who after two seasons have failed to qualify for the knockout stages, and they have invested a lot too!
Given the amounts invested, we would expect you to have a 15 point lead at the end of the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is thrilling.
I hope that by May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's just say we have a "Zlatandependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is very capable and he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to show that he is the star of League 1.
He has proven in every team he has been on that he is a great player, a world-class star.
We respect the man and the player in the group.
He also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to raise their game.
English: Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
