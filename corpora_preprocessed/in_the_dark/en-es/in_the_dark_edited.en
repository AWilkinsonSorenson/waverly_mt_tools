This is the podcast where I tell stories about folklore, some incredibly popular stories you think you know but with surprising origins, others, are stories you might not have heard, but really should. When I started this podcast I did not think I'd do an episode like this, urban legends, while scary, seem to just have one note, and the ones I was familiar with all just seem to be hyperviolent cautionary tales. Also, I'm not a huge fan of horror, scary stories. I've done precisely two and a half scary episodes in this podcast. As I get more acquainted with myths and legends to a degree that I'd never thought I would be, I started to notice something: the parts of us that led people to believe that a hydra lurked in the swamp, that a Viking might be able to live for 300 years or that a cat might be stealing their butter, #blameitonthebuttercat, those parts of us, they're still active today, with what are called urban legends.
And, when I say urban legends, they're not necessarily set in the city, they should be seen as, sort of just a modern kind of active version of folklore, and today's going to be a little different. I'm going to over a wide range of tales and talk about a few that I really like and offer my unqualified opinion on legends and misinformation.
Mike blinked awake, his mouth was dry and he had to go to the bathroom, he had fallen asleep on the couch, again. He cocked his head at the TV was playing some sitcom from the early 90s and he looked at his phone, it was 3 a.m., he laid back down and tried to will himself back to sleep, but he really had to go to the bathroom. Besides the light from the phone had already hit his eyes and he'd read somewhere that that killed melatonin production or something, Mike sighed, and he figured he'd better just try to go to sleep in his bed, he sat up on the couch and looked out on the sliding glass door. It was a quiet, cold night in late January, there was about a foot of snow on the patio. And the pale light from the crescent moon shined through the gnarled leafless branches of the trees, just beyond his property, and bounced along the snow, giving the night an eerie glow.
Mike rubbed his eyes and groaned, he always had a hard time getting back to sleep after waking up on the couch. He sighed and made to stand up, but when he saw the back door, he froze and gasped in shock. Outside the door was a man, Mike recoiled in horror, the man was barely illuminated by the light coming from inside and he had been watching Mike. He was gaunt and wrinkled, he had a twisted mad smile and a hungry look in his eyes, and he was looking at Mike.
Mike was looking right at him, but the man kept walking through the snow, toward the door, then, the stranger slipped his hand inside his coat and pulled out a long knife, he licked his lips and kept walking, that's when Mike saw it, he had left the back door unlocked. Mike screamed, he didn't have time to lock the door before the man got to it, he snatched up his nearly dead phone and scrambled to the bathroom, which, in Mike's tiny apartment was the closest room and just a few steps away. Mike made it to the bathroom, slammed the door behind him and locked it, he called 911. It was during the call that Mike heard the glass door slide open, he braced himself in the toilet and put his feet on the door, he had seen horror movies, he knew how these things happened. That psychopath was going to hack through the door, Shining style.
Mike just had to pray the police came in time, the first few minutes were harrowing and Mike stayed on the phone with the dispatcher. Fifteen minutes later, he heard the sound of police at the door and he hadn't heard anything else from his knife-wielding houseguest. His one-bedroom townhouse was tiny, and so the front door was only a few steps away, Mike grabbed the only weapon he could see, a toilet brush that wasn't used nearly as much as it should've been, took a deep breath and opened the door.
The glow from the TV illuminated wet, muddy footprints all over the mostly white carpet, the sliding door was left open, and the frigid wind was already starting to toss the snow over the threshold. Not wanting to look around him, Mike bounded to the front door, he threw it open and saw himself staring into the flashlights of the two police. They walked in with him, and they helped him search each room, they almost didn't believe him until they saw the footprints and the open door. They looked out on the snow in the patio and they could see footprints coming from the forest, they closed the door, turned all the lights on and did another more thorough search. They checked the crawl space, Mike's portion of the attic, everything. They simply couldn't find the knife-wielding stranger.
That's when one of the officers noticed something, she was looking at the footsteps, then she put her hand over her mouth, and stood up, she looked at the sliding glass door then looked at Mike, her mouth apage, she took a deep breath, and then she explained it. She told them that the footsteps, they were going the wrong way, the man hadn't been approaching the sliding glass door from the outside, Mike had just seen the man's reflection in the window, the man was already in the house, and he was already right behind Mike with the knife out, when Mike screamed and ran to the bathroom. The man, illuminated by the TV, and reflected in the window, only gave the appearance of approaching from the outside. And the sliding glass door opening wasn't the stranger entering the house but leaving.
The police followed the footsteps back to the front window, one that had been quietly forced open while Mike slept. Maybe that's what Mike heard to wake him up, they didn't know. Mike filed a report, but they didn't have much to go on and the two police officers followed the tracks in the snow to a nearby road that had recently been plowed. The man had completely disappeared. The police left Mike telling him that he might want to get an alarm and that if he has any more problems to give him a call, but there's was really nothing more they could do tonight. Mike shut the door and inadvertently followed the muddy footprints to the sliding glass door; it was locked now. And right before Mike slid the blinds over he took one last look out into the moonlit tree line and tried not to think of the eyes and the eerie smiling face that he had seen watching him from the darkness.
We'll talk more about urban legends in general a bit later, and, because there are elements that I don't want to ruin by dissecting, suffice to say growing up in the Midwest, this story hits a nerve for me. Growing up, my parents had a large back window that looked out into the woods, and I remember sitting there looking off into the darkness of the forest, wondering what might be looking back, I can't imagine the terror thinking that the danger of the outside was already inside the house, and, even worse, right behind me. The idea of not being safe in your own home is a chilling one. And it made me think of another urban legend that you've probably heard of. I'll talk about it quickly before moving on.
It's about a young woman who lived alone, and who only had a small dog for company. She was asleep one night and heard something or she thought she did. You know when you're sort of in a twilight sleep? And you are so sure you heard a sound but then you wake up to find your house completely normal? It was like that.
She snapped awake and sat up, the room was completely dark, she had blackout curtains and that's the only way she could sleep, and she reached around for her little dog. If there was something wrong, the dog would've awoken, she reached to his normal spot, and he licked her. The sound had just been in her head. There wasn't any noise, she fell back asleep. She woke late the next morning. Her dog didn't wake her up like he normally did, she found her phone dead, she reached for her dog, and kept reaching and then she felt his cold fur, she opened her eyes, and she screamed. Her dog had been killed and next to the body was a note, one that read: humans can lick too.
Now, you've probably heard that one, I've heard it many times but when I sat down and wrote it out it occur to me that the obvious psychopath who did this, it wasn't his first time in her home, no home intruder immediately rushes to lick a sleeping person's hand, he or she had been there before and had been watching the woman in her nightly ritual for days, or weeks from the darkness of her bedroom. That is almost way more scary than his weird little endgame of licking her hands, as ridiculously tragic as a dog death is.
I'm going to move from home to car, another fun spot for urban legends. I'm not going to spend too much time on these though, because these are the ones, I know you've heard. A woman was leaving late from work, really late, so late that she was the last car on the parking garage. She was driving on the highway home, when a large eighteen-wheeler truck speeding in the night came up behind her, it started flashing its high beams, and the women got over to let him pass, but the eighteen-wheeler, didn't pass. It changed lanes too, and stayed behind her, it kept flashing its high beams and blasting its air horn.
She tried speeding up to get away from it but it sped up too, she knew it was trying to kill her when it began ramming her bumper, she got off at her exit and saw that the streetlights were blinking yellow, the gas stations were closed, still, the truck followed her as fast as it could. Finally, she pulled up to her house, slammed the car into park and ran to her door. Just as the truck got there to block her in. She was fumbling with her keys when she saw the trucker get out.
He was a large, bearded man, eyes wide and red from hours on the road and he was angry, he grabbed a bat from the passenger's seat and rushed from his truck, but he didn't come after her, he went to her car, opened the back driver's side door and almost simultaneously the back passenger-side door opened and a man fled from it, dropping his hatchet. The woman had already called 911 and when the police arrived the trucker explained that when he was driving behind the woman on the highway, he saw a stranger from the back seat raise a knife, and he flashed his high beams to get her attention, when that stopped working, he started honking, when that stopped working, he started ramming, they never found the uninvited passenger.
I have to say, before I get all snarky with this one, that this story led to me checking the back seat of my car at night since I started driving. I don't remember how recently I've done it, but I'll probably resume it after this episode. Okay, one gripe and I'm sure you care, it does not make sense to me that the would-be murderer would want to kill the driver, when the car is going 80 miles per hour on the highway, even if the would-be murderer manages to pull it off, best-case scenario, he would have a car out of control with the body blocking the steering wheel and brakes. One slightly more believable scenario is one one where there wasn't a truck, but a woman stopping for gas on her way home, a sketchy man behind the counter was eyeing her in the car. And then he demanded that she come in because her credit card declined, when she got inside, he locked the door behind her and he called the police, he had seen the man crouching on the back seat.
Speaking of back seats, this brings me to the last car one. The popular hook hand, its set the 50s, so in the back seat, Harold and Sue were making out in their secluded spot a bulletin came on the radio saying that a dangerous mental patient had just escaped from an institution, he had only one identifying characteristic, but it was very notable, he had a hook hand. Because apparently, they let violent patients at psychiatric hospitals keep their sharp hook hands. The music and the making out continued and the successive bulletins came on the radio saying that the dangerous patient was in such and such area, the pair was in such and such area and Harold ever the prudent gentleman shut off the radio. Sue began to worry when they started to hear scraping at one of the doors and eventually, she became so distracted by it that they stopped, they raised the seat up and the pair drove off. By the time they found another spot it was basically curfew, so they just had to drive home, Harold was a gentleman and so he got her door, except that he just stood there, then he vomited. Sue opened the door herself but it scraped as she did. She looked down when she got outside and saw a hook stuck on the door handle with a bloody stump that it had torn from the violent escaped mental patient, I mean, you knew that was coming, right?
Teenagers and college kids are often the focus of urban legends, maybe it's because urban legends can be cautionary tales. Made to temper that impulsive, sensation-seeking drive inherent in the teen years, maybe kids are just more vulnerable, urban legends to me seem to have been carried over from centuries of parents warning their children of the dangers of the world in gruesome and violent ways. Because the world was a much more dangerous place back then. And the way from keep them from following that person on the road or wandering into that house in the forest or getting into a tickle fight with a hairy menacing stranger, was to get that warning to stick in the most salient way possible and that oftentimes involved violence.
