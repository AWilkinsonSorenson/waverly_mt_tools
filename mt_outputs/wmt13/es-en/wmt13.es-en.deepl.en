A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw the gain of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights were introduced in 41 states during 2011.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID in addition to proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to require it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
As a result, Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 do not have an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income individuals.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo ID.
And there is more.
In many states students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs that usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported legislation abolishing same-day voter registration in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 led to a drop in the rate of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted legislation in five other states that favored shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-American, while African-Americans represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true for Hispanics.
These represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: To test or not to test?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
This is more than enough reason to make men, already reticent in themselves, doubt whether or not they should be screened.
To take the test or not?
We have sought advice from two specialists.
Studies in the United States found a high rate of infection among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
On the other hand, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had undergone screening and those who had not.
The study, with a 12-year follow-up, also showed that there is a 30-40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend testing from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that are not life-threatening in the long term, in which case active surveillance of the disease should be chosen instead.
Today, many men who have been found to have cancer are not treated because the cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active disease surveillance and, if the disease progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend taking the test in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should be tested.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food and beverages
The agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Deli products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
Moreover, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing one's concerns and family history with one's physician.
"Getting screened does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What is more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still needed to be completely sure.
In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem small. We will see what it is.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you will end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that such a law also exists: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place at the same time.
According to Berkeley Lab's The Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles", through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson is in some way related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic critters we might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "messes up" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is none other than a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it requires extremely high energies, a bit like a frozen pond in which only a thick rock can slide across the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the large hadron collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool to explain the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stay stuck to a refrigerator door by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (such as the photon, by the way) do not.
But what can all this research "contribute", asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (SM), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and SM predictions.
For their part, many fervently wish they would meet, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, such as the fact that it does not propose any explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another oops!).
But we have found no such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day lives are difficult to predict, but we do not think we would be wrong in saying that it will have none.
Just so you see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in laboratories had no inkling of the revolution their work would bring about.
They hinted at scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, has already said, at the beginning the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
And furthermore, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light sensor in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.
Although it was by no means his original intention, this sensor now serves as the "eye" for all the world's digital devices, earning him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That is not to say, of course, that the LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know....
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon while a bill is being prepared.
However, within this essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to get a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, but I've already had seven," he says, lying on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even smiles and talks to strangers who give him attention, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of my diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," relates Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Going back to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide the "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"I have no more wishes left in this life," she says, before agreeing to be fitted with a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers offers body care and nutritional assistance.
They are palliative care given when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center's doctors.
Whether at the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort level.
The dying person is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics no longer have their blood sugar levels controlled.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the course of the evening.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," relates Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois center, the days are never the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man savoring his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
Some 53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
Seventy-seven percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the Grand Montréal home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major relative gap in Quebec health care that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent figures in palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before agreeing to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," he relates, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER in severe pain with no relief.
I fear that patients may wish to die just because they do not receive adequate care."
And at the same time, many oncologists stick with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already at an all-time low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry I wanted to stop fighting," he recounts.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their requests once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative home care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, physicians often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to put the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", it means "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP businessmen, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are part.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers too much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system pulverizes once we've hunted down the big media," ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal premier at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between the industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the transportation ministry alone would have saved $1 billion in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the "Marteau squad" police officers, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "sewer cartel" restrain itself when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded with the serial filing of fraud and corruption charges against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal road engineers and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a middleman linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito handed out money left and right during the 2000s, awarding more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the ruling Liberals.
He also admitted having organized an illegal fundraising campaign for the former Liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, field hockey games and bribes from construction companies totaling $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices by 30% to 40% as false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers at the height of the real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls "by a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and being very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected politicians who are aware of the scheme".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went into financing electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically says: "I've been told that this is only a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and party financing: "we cannot sink any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain this development?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I advance from day to day at his side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes so fast in soccer.
But I don't get overheated.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training center to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by leaps and bounds.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing at a very high level.
They know that every training session is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants such as Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all coaches.
Today, there is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a wealth of experience and has won numerous titles with top clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come off a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What are your thoughts on PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took away our leadership position.
But we are still in ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say against many very good European teams.
We want to start by finishing top of our league against Porto to be able to host the second leg of the round of 16.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Would not winning the cup in League 1, like last season, be a major failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in winning the championship title.
Last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions?
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, to still find things to reproach us for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the Round of 16, and they too have invested heavily!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you to be 15 points ahead at the end of the day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
This proves that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We might as well say that we have a "Zlatandependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of Ligue 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he has played for that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the France team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I managed to play good games in the national team.
It's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we are behaving in an exemplary manner today.
How do you view Didier Deschamps' first month in charge of the "Bleus"?
It is getting results.
They are well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires them to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the national team to Brazil.
Did the 1-1 draw in Spain on October 16 lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced such a game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of today's monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
Moreover, as is often the case with technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file sharing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price, after peaking at $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today to hover around $10 (quotes are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
This is not at all impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", which are used to advance in a video game and can be earned by playing or can be purchased (and sometimes even redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are at once ledger repositories, verifiers, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double key encryption system.
The network can then verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin exchanges are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
The winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this complementary line.
This is a file slicing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "slicing" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more leading zeros).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, most likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed with each increase in computing power.
Network life already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposit have been stolen.
"The bug used does not affect the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the potential for money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Major players such as Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant sales" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars was exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The bearer also manages his or her identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for retailers, who do not have to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to replace hierarchical systems with more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but 2013 could see a shift," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB expects to reassess the various risks, currently considered high, should this currency be successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have mainly punished Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban count on foreign extremists and former chiefs who are refugees in Pakistan, but often also on peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done by order.
The truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without coming under attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was engulfed in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking over government land to resell as building plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, while benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, I hear in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have experienced the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to these young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for cell phones. Television and its Turkish bulletins presenting a modern world have big fans all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already preoccupied with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, by abolishing the post of Prime Minister which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has reestablished its services, no reservoir has been repaired and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to take them over.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have all but abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddha site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, which were aimed at obtaining local labor, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military expenditures?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be free from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small amount of civilian aid, well controlled and reaching them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to play the all for all.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Only a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to judicial imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "betray his word" and "trample on the law".
Its supporters claim that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he stated in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "either you vote for my text or I maintain full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, overwhelmingly Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals did not attend the meeting.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
Commentators are amused, on the other hand, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at prayer time, so much so that several committee members went so far as to think that the Constituent's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all eyes, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who is to confirm its conformity with Shariah laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called upon to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The liberals' fears are further heightened by the fact that the next chancellor of that university would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity surrounding Article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent are civil judges competent to rule on all of this?"
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in number compared to what they were during the previous regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by associations for the defense of human rights.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles emphasize the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to appear on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF identified the five most important reasons why one should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal font" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the turning of water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, the calming of the storm and the full nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Way of the Cross or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews, the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will later come true.
Vertical travel
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who are dedicated to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit by funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Bus services are available from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly inhabited the mountaintop.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You will not be able to visit them all in one trip.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting ones.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.
His exhibition of paintings includes canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of old Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dali.
There are no tour guides or souvenir stores.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, displays one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
Israel's three main tourist areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to undergo courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to have their pictures taken.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
Money for this trip is not recommended in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged into shekels (currently $1-3,8 shekels).
Urban transportation consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tramway and in Haifa there is the only subway line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it is from a subway funicular.
Traveling by any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and stores close and public transportation stops working.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes combining milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities, there are no stray dogs to be seen.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that "walk at will" in an imposing manner.
At night you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrers love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, which costs $15 per day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
More than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
Most of those arriving to tour the country and rest were citizens of the U.S., Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% higher than the same rate in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: migrants save for language
While congressmen and human rights advocates argue about the consequences of the law on mandatory testing, scammers trading in "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since December 1, a law has been in force, according to which every labor immigrant will have to take an exam to test his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only for those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
Eventually, however, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language exam, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must also be confirmed in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights.
The network of examination centers will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian institutions of higher education.
Immigrants will be able to sit for the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law went into effect, managed many times to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will compulsory language knowledge bring about, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First of all, say representatives of the Immigration Service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labor migrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Migration Service representation in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must be initiated prior to your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of the cases.
The problems are the immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language and do not pass the medical control.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the prospective immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, will stick him with a "little paid trip" to a creepy, cramped shack, where he and dozens of others like him languish for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are cheated, deprived of their passports, not paid the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Labor Immigration Directorate of the Tajik Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little boss!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia admit that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families do not even have anything to feed their children, let alone clothe them, shoe them and buy them what they need for school.
As they reach adolescence, these kids venture out to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult if you don't know the language, they admit.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the language law is concerned, advocates make an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and, consequently, no official job.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden to strangers"
Many visitors say that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake registration can be done quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
Employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be forged.
Several "fake" certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights advocates.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Interior Ministry fails to crack down on illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered firearms is quite low.
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to civilian gun owners.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Apretar shootings during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogordov, in which Apretar seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on weapons possession will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counteract this problem by applying the "iron fist policy".
An open letter has appeared on the web, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless strictness" be abandoned.
The percentage of registered acts of vandalism with the use of weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told BBC News Russia.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the Internal Affairs bodies, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be an inconvenience for criminals to turn to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of illegal arms proliferation is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market for arms is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts gun orders
The first, "army or military remnants", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves," Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officers.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were set premeditatedly to cover up the fault," comments an ex-military officer.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers are also doing their bit.
"Now private arms factories have proliferated that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons underhand to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of arms," explains the former military officer.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly available data from gun-related portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archeology".
The clerk at one of the gun stores, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the guns found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time now because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a consignment.
Through some ensign, the supplier purchases a unit, e.g. a TT pistol.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two magazines," he says.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan needs to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from illegal gun dealers," the clerk adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique."
The seller and buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who suggested that I go to the "Begovaya" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "little corner" where we could negotiate.
I only found out about the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has connections," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are vendors, but there you also have to get there, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell you that his daughter's tooth had fallen out".
I can even get a pair of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I won't tell on him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was not "everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique," the serviceman recalls.
According to Baranets, the buyer is not being offered a pig in a poke: everything that is there can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buy a pistol or a machine gun."
There, users place their orders and post questions.
And do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I buy pistol TT. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and double-handedly captures those wishing to purchase firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish, to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia.

I have heard of such systems: as a rule, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People place orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Arms".
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you run out of a gun and get thrown in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and double-handedly captures those wishing to purchase firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the mid-ranking chiefs.
According to the ministry's official statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. go on strike.
Up to one-quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as McDonald's cashiers
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For now, no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and subside in its first stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart and fast food system workers, the goal of the protest organizers is the creation of workers' unions in these companies.
For the time being, this sector of the economy has been virtually unoccupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, the so-called "Black Friday". On that day, the orgy of sales in the United States began, which captured millions of inhabitants and was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, walked off the job and picketed alongside unions and left-wing activists at the corporation's stores, whose products target modest- and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers so little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
On that "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded salary increases and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation went from US$30 to US$100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who is paid $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive for them.
In one year they will spend a ridiculous $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters comment with satisfaction that the protest took place in only nine states and caused no loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday through midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers handled nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Company representative Dan Fogelman told the left-wing website Huffington Post in an interview that "fewer than five" Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest was just "another public relations stunt" organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city are not fond of them, and so for now there are none), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York are paid $8.90 per hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that kind of money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers stopped by McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as their main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at the McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks start being paid at least $15 per hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits management from preventing them from exercising this right and punishing union activists through chicanery and firings.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, notably City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and then doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, including New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said, "We must support fast food workers so they can achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described it, this was the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But it involved only a few hundred people, not all of whom were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"For now, tricking the brain is not so easy."
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is lately perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier in the summer, Google demonstrated a moving model at its annual conference, and later in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it emerged that for the company's scientists, glasses were already a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Input has improved (the system receives more data), and output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design technologies.
The IT world must be liberated to our world, to the physical world, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the surrounding space.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, the privacy issue remains to be solved, since we do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for device control in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not in single movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a wristband that recorded bone and muscle movement.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is it?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- You mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine a person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
In other words, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in the Z axis.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps is really low, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I would find an equivalent of such a device very useful for my work, but one that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And there is no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible tuning fork.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the curvature of camera placement and see how this would help determine three-dimensional position.
- As far as I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not introduced its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could move from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, therein lies their strength (private things only you will be able to see them), but also their weakness: a glasses-based augmented reality will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There is one problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile feedback!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
It registers the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic beams directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to what one feels if someone were blowing on one's fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what it seems he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very confined space believe that they are going to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like the ones in gyms), moving platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, fooling the brain is not so easy, it still needs to be worked on for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde", dedicated to citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of St. Petersburg's art and scene, whose achievements reach far beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing about them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always draw crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg avant-gardism of the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens smiles in the inhabitants and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took a barrel organ in his hands and became the organ grinder of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to play such a difficult role, because of his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around town wearing red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image makers and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of no good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at getting a conversation going.
The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with those after those exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I got into theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory on Pushkinskaya-10 and there, as long as there were no renovations, there existed a musical art club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought "La oreja de Van Gogh" to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator for many programs before Hali-galivskih's time.
We gave them Trachtenberg and that was the beginning of his great career; the basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club" are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uncultured.
- There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express actuality and occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being that way is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now they follow you by your clothes, focusing on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps that person should not even be shaken by hand, but spit in the face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change your clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of an urban organ grinder. - A cultured city should have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to group together in packs, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons wanted another.
Now everyone is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his or her 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they come in thousands!
- The abandoned women go to see him, the sex-social sphere functions there.
And 300 people go to a cultural event, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture of consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg lacking?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: culture officer.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones everything was different, the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are now very good consultants in Moscow.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because you need experts at a higher level to evaluate them correctly and pave the way for them.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land there.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is very small.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board depart in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity the main question is asked: how to continue the species in weightlessness conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus.... in space.
Problems of reproduction in space began to be addressed with the flora.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of orbit-grown peas were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophilae.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
The result is a normal chick.
But then the problems start.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks flipped randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we managed to hatch the chicks, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "mini-arch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only species of the same sex will travel on the "Bion" biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
The animals, having lost their usual habitat, are simply unable to realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years now.
The greatest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, to this question no one has answered," comments aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who had twice been in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
There are few of us, only a few astronauts to whom everything has turned out well after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"And if one can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory at the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
In zero buoyancy conditions, cosmonauts practice their space work skills.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, though still hostile, environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The little amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for it to get used to water later on.
In principle, this is logical, because only 2 weeks pass from the moment of birth to the time of the first bath.
"This is too little to forget anything," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepitate very quickly, and the capacity to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of labor stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the organism does not generate the skeleton and muscular system.
It is impossible to dress a newborn in orbit in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in our bringing to Earth a disabled, a totally maladapted person," predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
Eventually, however, this will become a reality, as humans in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home for their space-born children.
Head of NKÚ: Inspection of "švarc" system failed to find guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although enforcement is weak.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, deputy chairman of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," is how he describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor demand obligations," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in the framework of which the legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What is it exactly?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
To put it simply: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organized, followed by the legislation in force in each country, and then the actual practice itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation in our country is "stricter and more comprehensive", however, the actual practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely such a common control could help us to stop investing efforts in the concretization of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But just because we reduce the limit on awards does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, like the NKÚ, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Audit) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the competences are to some extent analogous, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the courts of audit are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Audit (BRH) can only control federal money, what we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, are controlled in Germany by the Federal Court of Audit.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to say exactly where it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
That's for sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make this kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a great number of problems.
If this were not the case, it would not be of any benefit to them to collaborate with our office, don't you think?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your office, and does it have any impact?
Taking into account that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet manifested itself in the control actions.
Since we perform ex post controls, a certain time lag is necessary.
For now, it can be seen in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool for "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have had almost 14,000 public awards passed and analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified and similar.
Do you consider that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations may be "tightened" and become impossible to comply with.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programs of the regional council), and every law not respected in the matter of public awards meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
So does it make sense to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of it?
We will see where this new path leads us.
The prime minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls on the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc" system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll do business as usual.
In the law on public procurement, the regulations are quite strict as to how to act formally. And that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads are icy, although most of them are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are icy and snow-covered.
Although most roads are passable, extreme caution should be exercised on some of them.
Karlovy Vary region
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they were icy and snow-covered.
Temperatures will drop to between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and the snow cover is thin in the low areas.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Montes Metálicos, snowfall reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region's road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the first-class highway in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
Likewise, all second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with ice and packed snow.
Increased attention must be paid to the road, especially in higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is danger of frost, and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate reports on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice patches forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads in the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of packed snow on the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, skies will be clear to partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will generally range from three below zero to one degree positive, with a weak wind blowing.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although extreme caution should be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early morning hours there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to information from the region's highway operations control center.
The D5 highway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometers 80 and 131.
The surface of most premium roads is dry and free of ice.
In the area of the Pilsen-Tachov road bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice slabs.
Second and third category roads are wet, so, in this case, there is also a warning of icy sections.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less traveled roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher elevations of the Olomouc region will encounter partially dumped snow.
After chemical treatment, snow still remained on the Červenohorské pass and on the track in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed the snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the higher areas of the Šumper road, snow remains.
Drivers on the Červenohorské pass will encounter half-dumped snow in the direction of Jeseník," an operator of the Šumper road administration confirmed to the ČTK today.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the slopes in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are passable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on different stretches in the early morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below freezing, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. In contrast, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the central Czech massif, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
At the moment, no service complications have been reported.
Road operators have warned of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day rain and melting snow is expected and at night the skies will be clear and icy.
From general roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut because of tree branches that had arched over the road under the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy.
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world is coming, what do you think about it?
It's just one of many alarmist news stories we like to cling to.
The Tap Tap band likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only band in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you are organizing a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a statewide benefit that we have been planning for the past two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the World, Cancelled".
Currently very popular on YouTube, will you be able to be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end....
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in the three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously thanks to a special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We even work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, in addition to organizing many charity events and concerts...
We are committed to participate in this project.
It has been proven that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised from the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equipment for the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we carried to completion in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Students at the Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they engage in fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
Each concert features several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalistic, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How are the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments....
However, we have managed well so far. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the East, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still rare for a person to move around the city center alone in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator is not common there.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematize the problems of people with disabilities.
In what aspects should we follow the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we are behind....
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a severe disability to move around on their own in public and to be able to go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead of the curve!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, everything will really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I joined as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to pursue something.
And since I am a musician, playing, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can also afford quality teaching staff, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that was there, that something can be done differently.
Show business is full of things that are similar to each other.
Logically, in its own way, everything new is greeted with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are capable of living a full life and developing themselves, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not only an advance for them, but for society as a whole.
Did it help that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand a certain discipline.
I think it is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they find out that they have to attend two days of rehearsals, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and at concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, it can't be helped.
Whoever has the will and the desire will always find open doors.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to jointly sing The Tap Tap's song "End of the World, Cancelled."
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, the cost of which amounts to CZK 25 million.
The concert ticket costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free admission in the pre-sale option at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA at last week's meeting of ministers of European Space Agency countries. It is the second ESA member country from the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland started an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left the audience indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one to show interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a dresina was built in Poland that was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who the author of the proposal was, nor are the details of the project known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for dresin startup or for braking.
The information on this dresina is limited to that collected in the press at the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material preserved, it is evident that the research has reached the stage of practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, research was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects on missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, the society is referred to for the first time with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a company dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become a member of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) sounding rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket on which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development was to be the subject of actual scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high altitude wind.
However, in 1962, work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the space available for scientific apparatus.
On the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 liters, on the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and on the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Instituto Aéreo, and its first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km altitude.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
Suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of more economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to close the gap and for this purpose "drives down" the competitor's price in order to gain the largest share of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor is higher than in other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the state's social spending necessarily increases.
This situation leads to a total lack of interest on the part of businessmen in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their eagerness to make profits.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population and, in this way, attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without regard to social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted entitlement of employees in terms of labor rights.
The result is growing poverty along with widening gaps between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years now, there have been food drop-off points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves through their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of assistance has now reached one million.
In the context of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, a rather frequent case occurs: people employed on such low wages that the state has to pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The austerity measures of practically all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, under pressure from an abysmal decline in their social status, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to eke out a meager existence on the fringes of society, in the hope that private investment capital will one day arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty is either passed from one country to another or never comes at all, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny fraction of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness the political course and, therefore, the whole state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission private law firms, which are often linked to industry, to draft legislation.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations were forcibly occupied".
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and help in financing stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unimpeded and people went to the polls with their votes prearranged".... "there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was without consuls for eight months".... "There began to be serious talk that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"..... Although Appianos was thinking of Pompeii, Caesar came to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on ill-considered preferences for individual benefit without regard for common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, with no effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favor of a liberal type of democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The truly shattering fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
Suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure of economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms that strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in the year 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right of self-defense and pigeonholes the Palestinians as terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and labels Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the periodically recurring massacres and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of the violence.
My intention is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, a look to discover who is profiting from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the prime mover in the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so clear is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the world's wealth in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power it implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Naturally.
In the 90s of the 19th century, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that their name would no longer be associated with serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, had their backs, which for them always meant empowerment.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild's Bank of America central bank status, began during the Civil War to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their lust for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially that of Great Britain, and the third aimed to reduce the population of the earth to between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamic of triggering crises and then offering a solution (order ab cao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created to avoid a repetition of the 1907 crisis.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and the ensuing World War I, they tore Tsarist Russia apart with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to finish off Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to covertly create a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for them to serve the Germans with the Führer's solution, which was strong and simple enough and pointed out the guilty parties, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority which was to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were occurring on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too hard on the rope to which he was originally tied by the international bankers or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers were to succeed in initiating it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within its own country, but also on an international scale. Take, for example, how sharply Israel's supporters and detractors are divided.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where injustice begets injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of a few individuals and their lust for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all world oil passes (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 now appear: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls his or her entire being.
"And he forces everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, to be unable to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the ciphers of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, let them add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six".
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the U.S., the country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive prospects: it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, since, if it did so, it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was subsequently further intensified by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by a rather extravagant cover story: they left on Canadian passports, as members of a film crew scouting locations in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie look true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's recollections.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode gone wrong, a hoax (an example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film is a combination of moods. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences from Tehran. In the credits sequence, emblematic photographs from the time of the events are shown, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this respect.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes, somewhat lighter, marked by irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to reboot his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respectable director and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little One, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Likewise, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is "shot" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy seizure is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages quite well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here it doesn't all come out so elegantly (the scene in which he stalks the crisis at the Tehran airport, the detour of a call to America and the wild search after his trail turn into madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little bit of dramatic flair, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, appreciating its execution and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But for it to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the latest development, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota for women in management positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey's organizer.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from better prices on life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers for life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline on the size of hen cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of the use of the expression "butter spread" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from stores has been criticized.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union's apparatus takes such decisions often under pressure from one or another business or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, is asserting the demands of its banks).
Lobbying interests were behind the demand, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU must be at least 14 centimeters long and must not have "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it was only seeking to harmonize national standards that had not been homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been relaxed on the grounds that the existing directive leads to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year's EU prescription according to which it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate inflatable balloons without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by suffocation.
A similar restriction is also in force for the use of cue sticks by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European civil servants: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to offend the sensibilities of Greece, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, which resulted in the threat of a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of providing a subsidy for grant applications.
These kinds of ideas did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we are landlocked.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said in autumn 2004.
He argued this with the fact that our country produced a lot of cereal and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export it.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
The grant to receive a subsidy was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
While the guidelines of the member states are often the target of criticism, the EU's efforts in terms of regulations and also more effective functioning and development throughout the Union are, according to several experts, more deserving of recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which the member states have secured in budget negotiations.
The Czechs, like other EU countries, are also sensitive to the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc curd cheese, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, to "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, along with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from the German town of Lübeck or Parma ham, there are already, for example, Karlovy Vary cookies, Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and even the Žatec variety of hops.
As protected EU maras, they can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and the wafers from Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did it occur to you to run for President?
It is not about being a senator or president.
If everything were fine in our country, then I would not run for office.
But I can no longer bear to see how people have been stealing in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, how taxes are increased and the retirement age is raised.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
To the Senate he has already arrived, but soon after he has set out on the road to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can realize my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate change.
Added to this are the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential fight with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
As president he does not have this competence and only the senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I was part of a group that lobbied for the guide profession to be recognized as self-employment, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholing or party dogmas, I have the capacity to be able to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
For me it doesn't matter, whether I'm a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don't care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or ODS and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
It is a joke when it is said that you are a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you say?
When you create a business plan for your company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without the support of parliament he is left with only slogans.
And with that he cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to get them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and state prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they do not want it.
If there is a strong character who points out the disputes, pressure can be brought to bear on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to take things forward myself, but in case it doesn't work out, in six years I will quit and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that with one person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to run for the senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought light heating oil frauds to light.
I applied on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for establishment representatives.
In the Senate there are two of us from the independent sector.
The people elected the senate, so it will be complicated to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have the time to do so, to check the spotless past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have the money.
I have no money even for the campaign for the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 kronor.
No money?
You talk about property declarations, what is yours like?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land valued at 25 million, an apartment valued at ten million, another apartment valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
He drives an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and he has no campaign cash?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
Not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there is not much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
Campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I could not live on it. For example, I couldn't pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 kronor a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I would not run for office.
So you will continue with your business activity in order to make a living?
Didn't you say before that you were going to stop this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As promised, I have partly stopped my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want him to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I continue to earn.
If I were president, then I would quit business.

Architectural firm MVRDV proves that real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "book mountain" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing by on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, notes, "Plus, the building is nice."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody goes into those old-fashioned libraries for fun, do they?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town on the outskirts of Rotterdam that barely merits a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was that policy makers decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas of the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master of the art of bar diagrams and responsible for buildings that are both amusing and cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in bewilderment and shrugged their shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size in a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse book mountain, the so-called `Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is standing on the planned site.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a subway parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and townhouses.
In early November the book mountain was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the small town lacking in history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall with a white façade that looks more like a dairy, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese factory.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy on the eye, the annealed brick floor and elegant lampposts unmistakably support the library's public status.
The urban environment is perfect.
Looking up you can see the park benches, the dogs and the children playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Usually the book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens up a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and move the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves that serve as wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up to date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it was that one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric only a few millimeters thick has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base to support the roots of crops.
It is an inexpensive and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until four centimeter thick sheets were obtained.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus trees planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is provided by geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the book mountain is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
Huge wooden trusses across the glass facade provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Likewise, professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
This is intended to fill, for the time being, the optical gaps in a library that does not yet have a complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has caught on.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there for decoration.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved success in this discipline, which in specialized jargon is known as "creating an identity".
The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
Regardless of how young and uneducated she may be.
Finally, a starting point to shape their identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role".
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories UN observer state status.
In the end, however, Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the country's special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the U.S. position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are therefore at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they are still feeling out what their role will be, but they have already started on the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean in concrete terms from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken on the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion and Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't read too much into it since it's not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
This may have earned Germany a certain amount of respect.
At the end of the day, all this has only demonstrated that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
In contrast, the U.S. has come out clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows great understanding for the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I believe that the real disparity of opinion is not really of the magnitude attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is Germany finding it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but this is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a superior entity, but must push things forward from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course this is not at all easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of a major international player? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or perhaps you still find it difficult to accept such leadership?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always a bit awkward and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a major player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the USA in European politics is increasingly diminishing, but the EU does not fill the gap for the time being, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known worldwide and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name that is officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then, it is not clear that they will be given the nod.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney with Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in protective rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives on my desk.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters in order to register their trademarks.
Thus, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered as Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copying each other in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps entries from the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that also made use of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large multi-storey department stores dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to profit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" for a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's detrimental to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand takes on water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, obtaining the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registry is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Proceedings can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had elapsed that the name that was the subject of the lawsuit had already become a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarizer because the process has damaged the plagiarizer's brand in China," Pattloch points out.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been taken over by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why to this day the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a blue-and-white logo that was highly reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to change it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that they have had difficulties in 2010 due to shortages of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labor emergency situation returned to normal".
As a result, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are staggering.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
This also seems to be the case for the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, they reportedly pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in royalties.
Put another way, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the copycat has managed to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"We have brought this situation on ourselves because surnames are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich-based company's appeal.
In the next two instances Freudenberg has been upheld, but the opposing side is still fighting today.
You have to be very, very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that the matter can be resolved favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time".
Internal costs are difficult to estimate; the corporate archive has had to review files up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but was unsuccessful.
"It shows how much we care," notes Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
particularly if the imitators secure there the rights to unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg in Germany for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial field, but nevertheless managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be extremely careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and attorney Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law; what is needed is "to register everything that can be protected in China as well," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, he would then have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Either that or we would be driven out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg and AIDS orphans rejoice in Swaziland
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and loafers search for the beat on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (alto, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get almost out of hand as he tries to bring order with his forceful and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute for Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from the human geneticist to the householder, have also arrived.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and moreover in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, approximately 34 million people worldwide are infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and will guarantee one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegyrist" in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes transports them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northeastern part of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large number of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what ails Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancies in the world, according to Unicef.
Circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is frowned upon by the population.
More than 40% of Swazilanders are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their thirties has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this remote village, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but also the basics: food, clothing and education.
Without a school diploma, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
In the beginning it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since then been professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
STDs of bacterial origin include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more frequently in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were registered in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through soil infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you change sexual partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, from the fees the choir charges for its performances all over Germany, they manage to raise quite a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," Annette Lennartz, president of the association, points out proudly.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman with leadership skills, manages the money sent from Germany.
She makes sure that the orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof over their heads and see to it that the children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has started a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, has succeeded in getting many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one place to another and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms are available on every street corner, but they are hardly used.
It's a different culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to bring a couple of tears to the eyes of the occasional rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town hardly appears on maps, it is well known in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Come closer to Esitjeni, the light shines there," say the locals.
And after driving the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street filled with singers marching in step, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also water ice there, as shown by three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reportedly found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in shadow.
It appears to be at least 30 centimeters and probably up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one is linking the ice find to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger's chief investigator, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images back to Earth: small windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is not a "planet" at all.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named W5 by scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars form from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", is an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope the colors can be better appreciated.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a land continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifidus comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark dust lines divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carom: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are hurtling towards each other, only to collide irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it by the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way galaxy.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continually rising; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this very bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is erected.
It allows observing the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), anyone with a computer can help by providing processing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Imaging is not expected to be possible until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new telescope of enormous proportions with a mirror diameter of thirty meters is planned for Mauna Kea.
This is an image of what it would look like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is also ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no hard evidence, since the Messenger probe circles the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first probe to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the winding road past forested hills, fast-flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think you are in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people about whom not much is known, apart from the fact that they are fluent in Persian and Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists hardly ever come here, as the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will hold the World's Oldest People Festival," Fatulayeva notes.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Documented here are the lives of eight dozen local talyshis who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son died at the age of 136 years.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify this.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is rather suspicious.
"She was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. He apparently still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şirali Müslümov then mistaken his age by a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very old people living," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific proof of age, especially since there is no civil registry.
Everyday glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum's director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the diet.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the Talyshi, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it is the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age, he is relatively young by the standards of these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents some time ago.
Also jumping up and down are two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in typical convex glasses.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under her scarf she hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live on
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I have never gone shopping in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the period after World War II.
However, everything got back on track when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the father figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he passed the baton to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva is paid 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount on which one can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray-haired son is right: "in our culture the elders are highly respected".
They live in a big family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this were not enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights".
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And for that to happen is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, hopelessly mired so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologetically, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world knows very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour-long night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what is meant by "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it appears that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway that goes with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters relating to Shariah it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all of Sunni Islam.
It need not be so, but this could mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that would - in effect - result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exercise harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state is to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To put it bluntly, it is nothing more than censorship.
Incidentally, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legates.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it is to be sanctioned.
Equally dubious is the formulation prohibiting "offense to persons".
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution is back."
For weeks now, the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of Islamist superiority.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to derail the Act before it can go into effect.
"The revolution is back and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is in third place in the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history."
Via Twitter he accused Mursi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Quran is our constitution."
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Mursi "clean up the country," while proclaiming, "the Koran is our constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, Mursi's supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
Muslim Brothers claimed that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should take.
In this regard, it appears that the Islamists' draft is guaranteed a majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear."
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended Muslim Brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression `Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three branches of government caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which watches the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns, "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the world's smelliest fish?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has something to do with its appetite for extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet soccer clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowy. The scenery is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes dedicated to this most, shall we say, captivating delicacy.
"You eat it raw and then drink a glass of aquavit in one gulp," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also what is known as the "Rakfisk General," who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we go we see people eating this fish, which is kept in small buckets, and drinking large quantities of the beverage in one gulp.
"Some people like aquavit better than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drinking can kill the odor.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it's not bad; it's not much different than a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty was rife in Norway and when, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is well fermented, it is taken out and, obviously with the senses inactive due to the alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants from Sweden, the old rival and until not too long ago much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, if rather smelly, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10€ ($14) each.
Norway is not usually on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
People here are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who gunned down and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 event."
Norwegians find it extremely hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she passes around trays of rakfisk and who, with her long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to show off, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone else was wasting money they didn't have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a lighthearted laugh.
I'm in the snow standing in line to get something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that smelly fish returns.
The hotel where I'm staying is one of many venues that hosts a rakfisk dinner where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the most nostril-testing fish.
A television has gone live with a presenter wearing a bow tie and surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps overcome by aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a rough start
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city that, under the best of circumstances, is already congested as it is, a steel fence has been in place since Monday, cutting off several of the main roads leading into the city and causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from being able to reach their workplace, but to prevent protesters from being able to reach parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take office.
You face a complicated task.
Mexico has been doing well economically under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is mired in a drug war that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Prior to rubbing elbows with the U.S. president, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A densely populated and fast-growing state surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Residents credit him with the growth of tourism in the area and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and potholed roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with his name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will succeed in bringing about real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a congressman for Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Particularly when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the exciting and real change that our country so badly needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unseated by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years away from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are high expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the opposition's characterization of the new president as lacking in substance.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision for the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, he is a good listener."
On the other side of the state, however, that is not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly severe.
On a deserted plot of land next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately notorious for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the rundown neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to struggle to hold back tears as she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I got to his house, it looked as if his body had been cleaned," Mrs. Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already set in."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks out from the walls, next to a cross with a single word on it: Justice.
Yet that is exactly what the family says they have been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his term.
"I hope he is the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the Ciudad Neza victims fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not report abuse, prosecutors say
Prosecutors seek to address allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning while in prison
Trial focuses on Manning's time at Quantico military prison in Virginia
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Manning's imprisonment was harsh
The Army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors sought to show Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During prosecutorial cross-examination of Manning at a pretrial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein asserted that records of weekly visits by unit officers that Manning received during nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, show no allegations about his treatment.
The questioning, which took place during a hearing following a defense motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that his incarceration had been harsh and that it had been punishment enough, came a day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits with Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was incarcerated in maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers reportedly asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When asked about the forms by Fein on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described his treatment by orderlies as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional."
The forms show no allegations of mistreatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about his treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concerns about some issues and that the visiting officers had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not put those issues on the record.
"They were writing 'no incidences' (after discussing the problems) but that doesn't necessarily mean I hadn't mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he received during a January 2011 meeting with a board charged with examining suicide intentions he had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime under which he was placed.
The military said it had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is one grade below suicide watch, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was OK and (wanted) to get off injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being moved to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what was happening to him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world came down to just Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell for at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours unaccompanied.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointed at his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the orderlies could not see his face when he turned over at night, they would wake him up to turn over again.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday's deposition that, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was forced during a morning roll call to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the recount.
During questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said he inferred from the order given to him by the warden that he should drop the blanket with which he might have covered himself, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before in an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic from his underwear or his flip-flops to self-injure but that he had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted at the court martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser crimes and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to any detainee in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, unlawfully causing the release of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He states that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times.
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely walked down the concourse and into the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Signs indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and the other for "Foreigners".
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I have been called "Mexican" my whole life.
This is ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends label themselves "Italian."
Later I decided to go with "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
It was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native speaker and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and got in the foreigners' queue.
I thought of that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, was immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why Mexicans are now as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries even the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma go on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about rancor?
There is a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was shut out of opportunities in Mexico and had to move north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may not be clear at times, but our loyalty is.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexican ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as if we were of an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter are bothered by it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are part of neither.
We love to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted to any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things further, from what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as impromptu "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit that country and lobby political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That is not going to happen.
There is too much rancor.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be on your own with this idea, folks.
It is fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still resent the way their relatives were treated much, much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the usual useless bickering over who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in tatters whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to believe that their lethal stalemate could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 holds, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has taken a beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and squeezing Gaza's 1.7 million inhabitants into one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to wipe out Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced the Hamas cause. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah party-militia dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent could topple Bashar Assad, all the way to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on Israel's southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal of the Arab countries, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even by Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, Hamas has been put in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven effective and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep easier... for a while.
On the diplomatic front, the United States is more assertive than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite the fact that, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even more hard-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on Jan. 22, is in a good position.
Why coddle those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good whack if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere are not too fond of Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area's superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to bring about the cease-fire bodes well and could mark the start of something.
Israelis should also think long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to repel Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outsiders.
The solution remains the one touted by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the ceding of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsider Arabs should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the impending attempt to obtain virtual statehood at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude represents a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Tobacco plain packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased body parts appear on dull green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands.
Australia's world-first tobacco and plain packaging law comes into force, replacing brand logos and colors with dull olive green packaging, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies sickened by smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory as of Saturday, are the brand names, all printed in a small font.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
Australia's federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by removing the trappings that glamorize the habit.
Rely on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he or she never will.
"You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related a crown logo to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect multinationals' profits too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market in tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will carry serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The amount of tobacco brought in by counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia will increase.
Others say their business has benefited following the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover up unsightly images on packs had shot up from almost zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's High Court.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and was waiting for more stock.
"For us, it's good business."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the target demographic.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most retailers to keep cigarettes out of sight, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising on local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign websites.
"If you market tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in brand reviews from "everyday citizens" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry is more focused on what the new regulations entail than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have significant trade volumes with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a ruling in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had been in talks with other countries that are considering similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce mandatory images on cigarette packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"Photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them".
"You take the cigar and put the pack away," says Victor El Hage as he buys a pack with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in downtown Sydney, points out that the uniform packs make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to unwrap a delivery; now it takes me four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned tobacco altogether and then, that's it, okay, that's it, we're done and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands upward.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored.
During the Thanksgiving holiday this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had lots and lots of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention the duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and child development experts are extolling the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it's okay for us and our children to be bored from time to time.
Being bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, nowadays, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Yes.
And no.
But, we will talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History," published in 2011 by Yale University Press, argues, this is not the case.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also ask ourselves how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in so many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and pitching the idea to a focus group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting to, but not being able to, engage in an activity that fulfills you."
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person is not doing something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The primary experience of boredom, he says, is "disruption of the attention process, associated with low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly."
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem as their own.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what is really happening to us is that we are having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened to an unrelated television program at full volume in the next room, others listened with the volume turned down so that it was barely audible, while the third group did not hear the audio at all.
The group that listened to the program with the volume turned down showed more boredom than the other two groups; they found it hard to concentrate, but were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, attention disturbance can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective parts on a manufacturing line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that fidgeting or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat boredom by making that person more physically alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to be bored at some point: a plane delay, a monotonous speaker, a particularly dull movie.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure this, researchers developed a "boredom tendency scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do everything".
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by pager.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Prof. Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates 21 years later would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest heights," largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question at the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as gambling or substance abuse as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he won't have learned how to entertain himself or how to dose himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose down applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"The way we see it, we need to be bored more, but boredom is too distressing and unsettling a desire to relate it to anything worthwhile," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to unwind and enjoy some downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: no briefing book for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal statewide: possession of a few rocks of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors that each carry a fine of US$100) informing him of the trial date.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped charging those over 21 with small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law has gone into effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's more conservative district attorneys have vowed to move forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This is all changing so fast, I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington State are also giving the matter some thought.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a licensing system for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales, all before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any one place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent to serve as a model for us," he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which to swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some tricky mechanical issues to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to licensed marijuana and its prohibition on conducting cannabis business within 300 meters of schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metro area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On Nov. 21, Oates, Aurora's police chief, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city attorney would stop bringing misdemeanor prosecutions for possession of marijuana for persons over the age of 21 and that police would stop charging such offenses "effective immediately."
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce the city's regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and traffickers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to put pressure on users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those offenses that at the time they occurred were criminal," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I don't consider that I am wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use into the mainstream of government and the judicial system was never considered to be easy.
The mixed reactions emerging throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials about the great environmentalist experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with district attorneys," says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law.
"They've spent so much time taking people to court that they really still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana the same as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials are counting on a new frontier of legal sales, they are also anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still envisions the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates are hopeful that the Justice Department will relent.
Although there have been some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to exist in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While drug agents are not likely to kick down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will probably be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana permitted under the new law to operate," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted for versus voting in favor of what the state voted for."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory".
University students are not being attacked for their views only now.
I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been to what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I had packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had dropped out because I would not tolerate some college roommates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink out of chipped cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, nor the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of so-called enlightenment was somewhat bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what that's all about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative Party students is such at Oxford that, last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights that homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities have.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's JCR (undergraduate student group) claim they are "often seriously ostracized, personally attacked and treated as personae non gratae" because of their political views.
They want to create a seat on their college's equal opportunity committee to ensure that they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics that portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and a cane with a silver grip.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Party Association at Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history major at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA president-elect, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford I was as lonely as the next person.
I entered college in September 1986, a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at an all-time high.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary degree following cuts in Higher Education funding.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with horror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new university students, when the new students meet and get to know the professors, I received a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative academics, but participated in it willingly.
The politics of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa found their way into the wooden rooms of the seminary.
The first one I attended involved translating 18th century French texts into English and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't give a single one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake batter, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that the Thatcherites refuse to learn French or is it that they are simply stupid?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to hold back.
"I suggest she go to French lessons in her spare time, as long as she's not too busy meeting people," Pitt growled.
I went back to my room like a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinnertime at the university; then I felt a light pat on my back.
He was a sophomore English major named James who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he told me kindly.
"I'm afraid that's the way it goes.
They pick on anyone suspected of being a Tory.
For me it is very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many newcomer Tories pretend to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to dissemble.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year Philosophy, Politics and Economics student who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.
Other students adopted that ditty.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat the crap out of each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to become Labor and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead of me looked like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only from the Conservative party, but also Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was barely around.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His sore eyes began to cloud over.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they just did it as a joke.
It would break my heart if you left him."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional stamina was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another history professor had implied, in all seriousness, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men."
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You may call me a weak crybaby.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 Conservative party prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind a far from deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture", a spectacular retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
The first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, is filled with private letters and photos signed by the highest echelons of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble couturier in the town of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful pop celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his chalet in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing Valentino
Argentinean model Valeria Mazza has not forgotten the couturier's charisma either.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything you could see and feel his spirit.
"He made each of us guests feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who began working with him during Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he finishes.
Parade of lineage
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-meter long catwalk that proposes a role reversal: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to contemplate a dream "audience" wearing Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg shine in this audience of mannequins.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and are "donor" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino either.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at the chateau of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a ruffled skirt, draped corsage and a strapless neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses from the couturier with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it brings with it".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding gown from her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the couturier calls his seamstresses) to create this ivory silk gown inlaid with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority in the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return of the high society clientele".
Obsessed for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now its best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time does not pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The world's toughest job: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano porters risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur up steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend each day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies on contact with the air.
After pulling up large sulfur rocks, weighing a total of about 70 kilograms, he carries them in two bamboo baskets over his shoulders along steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters, but it takes the exhausted porters more than 40 minutes to ascend at a snail's pace, keeping their balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the Kawah Ijen cliffs years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they mine
Once at the top, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, wearily carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scales that a mining company has placed a little further down, at 1,850 meters above sea level.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries three loads a day.
It takes him three hours on each one and he ends up ground down, but they allow him to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a pittance for such inhuman effort, it is three times what I would earn in the field.
"The miners' wages are very high here, where coffee picking is paid at 15,000 rupiah (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupiah (167 euros)," says the porter, who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupiah (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason that, in Indonesia, is as blunt as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic fumes.
At 27 years of age, Anto has been risking his life in the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll despite the fact that he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Chastened by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Braving the shadows, Anto descends into the crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
Some 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its handsome profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs, nor does it supply any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and at their own weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupiah (2.5 euros) camera surcharge that, along with the 15,000 rupiah (1.2 euros) entrance fee, the rangers of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for beasts and not for people," protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has been on the Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, she says she will keep working "as long as she can" because she needs the money to raise her three children, aged 18 and 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so tough that none of them complains of serious illnesses... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pains and sores on their shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years of age.
Every day, he and his colleagues remove 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks take to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a goat path through the undergrowth.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," proclaims Unainik, opening wide his mouth, where he is missing several teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: that of the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let's fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an ad for mints, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that the ad will draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty."
This is purely an internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1,2 children
The one that doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends US$1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a declining birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to drastically increase immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, websites abound with thinly disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, whom they criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the Singapore example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to prevent so many small houses from being built.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes," that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units sell out days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hindered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off," says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it's important to have my own money and time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to baby-making, Singaporeans have the final say.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it refers to the quality of privacy or "the sphere of private life that one has the right to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a child under 16 years of age?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by airing situations on the Internet that you would certainly not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very much mine", on a personal level, and "in the password and user name", when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't upload to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not everyone," she says.
On FB I upload nice or game pictures.
I also entertain myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't of me, or someone making a fool of themselves," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene pictures, pictures of naked people, pictures of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the password to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would I listen to someone who recommended a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, none of them have approached him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it I would just take them out of my account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who I was," she assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"He just put privacy on it."
It then explains a series of steps to securely set up the account.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I don't like him or feel like it.
"Even though I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game changed," he mentions.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and is the author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what is or is not convenient to broadcast, publish or say at an age when maturity is not enough for that".
"Also that they are selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't help," he adds.
Below, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask permission from the other people to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you are doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
They are the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it should be the same in social networks," he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential for parents to read social network policies thoroughly.
By understanding each of the items, they have a solid foundation for talking to their children about the implications of opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what you are allowed to share or post," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the "don't talk to strangers" lesson.
Unasur Summit ends without issuing the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven presidents attending.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially stated that it would be delivered after the closing ceremony, but later stated that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound, with the message "private session, audio restricted".
The little information that circulated among reporters was provided by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian government.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents in attendance, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been previously announced, was not disseminated either.
On the official ASPA website it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made every effort to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited as much as possible the gathering of information.
The summit also concluded with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Court of The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the ICJ, which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties in the process that Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that today we are taking to this international court," said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, together with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously flawed.
The summit was held with the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after midday in Lima.
The President read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and lines of action were established for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residency".
He informed that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to internet at low prices in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," added Humala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas...uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute following an ICJ ruling, questioned by Bogota.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible that I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are scheduled to meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Likewise, as part of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense matters in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state-owned TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those that have signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who give lectures never commit themselves to anything, but we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding," he said, alluding to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision because he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "profound democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his process would not be respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for demanding that he submit himself in its territory to interrogation for an alleged sex crime when "Swedish law itself allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health could deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he has been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
What there is is the danger of deteriorating their physical and mental health by being confined in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe-conduct allowing him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European instances," he mentioned.
And he opined that "if Great Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over".
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will be over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm his position as a defender of freedom of the press and added that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists for profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries are no longer the ones who dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected "he will deepen the revolution to continue on the right path and in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's veto in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coups dressed up as legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between both countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this ruling is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to process them in a comprehensive manner in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries are committed to accept a ruling, no matter how harsh it may be".
In reference to the possibility that he may run as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he views this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, such socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, so we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term in the presidency and from there we leave public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he traveled for a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he waited for the campaign to pass before returning to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Chavez's health condition", he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today are due to late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: AIDS positive.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me," he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "softer," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take charge of his illness on his own and began to learn more about it, so much so that he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he had a cut".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and become victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this moment means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", indicated the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
An infectologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation of the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who are diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as they remain under control, they will be able to live without problems until they are 75 years old", explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not one of access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medication, the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they are unaware of their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a convincing fact: "Nine out of every ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection. What needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, screening tests must be offered on a massive scale to all those who require them".
Specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree with his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for the test, motivated only because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they are going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I might as well bust three times a week," they say, not in my case.
The change was for the better, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
If they were at risk, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they are already diagnosed, they should learn that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has effectively increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packs of one hundred, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among those most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with derision and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, said the communicator.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms should not be only behind the counters and that these 100 condoms should be found in public restroom dispensers in places frequented by young people.
It is not to encourage promiscuity.
Nor is it a matter of paying for their drinks and motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez answered when asked if condoms would be distributed in his administration.
"That's not how sexuality is, the best thing to do is to bring condoms closer to those who are already sexually active," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th nationally in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV, since for every registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
With the ratification by a U.S. appeals court of a ruling that disregards the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt achieved through a bankruptcy proceeding in Mexico, the scenario sets an ominous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would seem, therefore, that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms allowed by Mexican law are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
On a practical level, the endorsement of the ruling issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of seizure of their properties across the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
First of all, while the judge in the case states that the creditors must abide by the U.S. Bankruptcy Law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding is the insolvency proceeding in Mexico.
The first point would imply disregarding international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to this end, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity in International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute acting as arbitrator.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, the debts owed to the parent company by Vitro's subsidiaries being recognized in the critical mass of the insolvency proceeding, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy (Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles).
Furthermore, subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, Vitro's creditors that fought against Vitro in the U.S. Courts, i.e. the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
This fact is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it faced from 2008 onwards in the wake of the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, which hit the country hard.
For the time being, the González Sada family firm will file an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote may reach the full court, that is to say the five judges, since only three voted.
If this does not succeed, the Cerciorare remedy will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court overlooked a document sent by the Mexican government as amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Bankruptcy Law, indicating that it was carried out in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to match it with Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Law.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-sided carambola: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
Balance Sheet
The complaints filed by the unions of Mexicana Airlines against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, have been dormant for several months, and the Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The agency headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to provide reports to the Attorney General's Office on a transaction carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of Administradora Profesional de Hoteles.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the Universidad del Caribe, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking about, as you know, a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously succeeded in unifying the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose the monumental bullring that razed part of protected areas and poses the mother of all threats against the industry.
ACTA is dead
After the government ignored a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has been placed on file.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility, considering it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term debt without affecting short-term debt, the housing developer Homex is placing 500 million pesos of Certificados Bursátiles in the market.
The issue is the first of four identical issues offering to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
The companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, have recently formed a consortium under the name Competival, whose objective will be the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life".
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been linked to basketball for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, he has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of the history of local basketball as broad as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a youth player, a National Superior Basketball player, an agent and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federation president during the 1990s," recalled Reyes during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in making this assertion.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia denoting his extensive career, attest to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all of them, the ones he treasures with the greatest emotion are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he served 15 years as co-captain or manager of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships for the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-prospect or manager.
There were many satisfying years, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year in the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had coached here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I've got a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best marksmen.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring one more.
He enjoyed the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already the head of the federation.
By that time he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy's performances on the National Team.
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the Pre-Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came in fourth place and should have been bronze had it not been for that Canadian referee who made us replay the final play a second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best National Team you have ever seen?
It is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze medal at the World Cup.
That team not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter as youngsters, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to play in the 90's due to a knee injury.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended due to the Mar del Plata Pan American Games, we won gold against all odds.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculín did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That one is very difficult.
We have had a very good crop that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90's the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have left to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
For example, the Ponce boys will only play in their area and will only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruits of the compulsory certifications and courses for officials, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoying the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.," in the television series "Dallas," in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by "Dallas" producer Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again portraying the iconic role he loved the most," the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he met.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, caring and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995 he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman made a name for himself on television as a decent guy on the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live with him.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly obnoxious J.R. that brought Hagman to the height of his stardom.
The CBS network drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked at bookmakers.
It also helped give the series record ratings at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in history, behind the 1983 finale of "MASH," which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. impregnated her and then threatened to brand her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable crook with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and a cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), committed.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read, "Here lies honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen."
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on TNT channel.
Filming had already finished on five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in process, the network reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatrical stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought was going to hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became an advocate for organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I counsel them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come in for their surgeries, and afterwards," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, such as "don't be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you're going to be fine."
He was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Course to explore the "End of the World" begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: the end of the Mayan Calendar's "long countdown" on December 21, which many people have clung to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what the next couple of months had in store for him: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmageddon," and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-times theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University-Camden (N.J.) this week.
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they provide hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only "The End of the World."
"We didn't add '2012' so that we always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "right up until the very night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It overcrowded in two hours," Restall said of his course for high GPA students, which filled up with 35 students.
We received email messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Religion and Sociology major from Haddonfield, N.J., at Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old Psychology and Nursing major, said he has seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I'd never heard of a class that could teach that," he noted.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said they believed in the Dec. 21 expiration date.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and we kind of debunked it," said Temple senior Julie Zeglen, 21, of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in such speculation.
"Elsewhere people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University teaching courses in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond to a question about whether he knew of any "end of the world" courses there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many doomsdays, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
