A Republican Strategy to Hinder Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that voter fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights were introduced in 41 states in 2011.
New election laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present photo IDs.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect youth, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use their institution-issued photo ID.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to set up a helpdesk for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration drives contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 resulted in a fall in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It could, in part, limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Get Tested or Not Done?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
This is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant, doubt whether or not they should be screened.
Get tested or not?
We have asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States found a high rate of infection among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that are not life-threatening in the long term, in which case you should opt instead for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test in any case.
But it's important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not you should be tested.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.
This document (currently only in English, but translations will be available shortly) can be downloaded from the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet for preventing cancer.
Despite research progress, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is still the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
Weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large numbers, they increase the risks of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are conflicting.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing one's concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Screening does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated quite a stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in effect, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What's more, it's about the particle whose existence the Standard Model predicted: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim. We'll see what it's all about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also such a law in it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; A "state" that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other are the bosons, a filthy bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can find themselves in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Labs, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "messes" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; A bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide on the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on its own glued to a fridge door.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what "can all these investigations contribute?" asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of the SM.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation related to gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another oops!).
But we haven't found any such differences at CERN so far.
Impact
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day lives are difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong to say that it will have none.
Just so you see: in the early 60s, the pioneers of laser in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned it the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, but I've been like this for seven," he says, lying on his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even smiles and talks to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured of my diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to their childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The 89-year-old Ms A.'s greatest fear is to die "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more desires left in this life," she says, before agreeing to have a mask put on to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the coming days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, body care and help with food.
It is palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center's doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer controlled their sugar level.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois centre, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man savoring his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 who are suffering from cancer," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from home and 47% from hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
Some 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care facility.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the home palliative care society of Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is agreed.
"Recently," she says, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room suffering great pain without having done what was necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they're not getting the proper care."
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already at a low when she stopped a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is absolutely not all-powerful when it comes to pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want relief."
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from Canada's health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP businessmen, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell us, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", which includes the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system is pulverized once we have hunted down the big media," says Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal to erupt in 2011, made possible by an in-depth investigation into embezzlement linked to highway contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal premier at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, while hoping to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "the Marteau squad", who, since 2009, have made the Montreal "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial registration of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been charged.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money left and right during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the ruling Liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for the former liberal deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction companies totaling $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% as false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of the real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and to be very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of "elected politicians aware of the ploy".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and party financing: "we cannot fall any lower; Going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain this progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I advance from day to day at his side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a match, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't get hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.
He will profit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He's backed up by adjuncts like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all coaches.
Today, there is no one like it in League 1 and it is among the best European coaches.
He has a wealth of experience and has won numerous titles with top clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken away our top spot.
But we are still in ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the knockout stages in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say against many very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish first in our league against Porto to be able to receive the second leg of the knockout round.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is dedicated to its means for that project to materialize.
Would not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, constitute a great failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It's normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted that.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, that they still find themselves with things to reproach us with is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We tried to launch a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the knockout stages, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better that we say that we have a "Zlatandependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the France team?
It has been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good matches in the national team.
It is what I expected since my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we are behaving in an exemplary manner today.
What vision do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month at the helm of the "bleus"?
It's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will take the national team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file sharing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after having reached the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (the quotes are counted on page bitcoincharts.com).
This is not impressive compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or euro," and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and sometimes even redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both ledger depositories, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are recorded in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This involves solving a mathematical challenge thrown at computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a phase of file chopping, that is, transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chopping" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; Any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen on deposit.
"The flaw used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money whitening thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Heavyweight players like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant sales" were launched.
"$30,000 was exchanged," glees Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, currently considered high, in case this currency is successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have mainly punished the Afghan farmers, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chiefs who have taken refuge in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was made by order.
The truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul unattacked, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, snapping up government land to resell as plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; Most of them have not fought.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have known how to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived through the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are filled with both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for mobile phones. Turkish television and its cartoons that present a modern world have huge fans throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly ahead of elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 50s and even earlier.
No industry has restored its services, no reservoirs have been fixed and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to take them over.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddha site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to restore normal relations.
French troops departed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These works, greedy for local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase in crop areas.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military expenditure?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys often located more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small amount of civilian aid, well controlled and reaching them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to go all out.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "betray his word" and "trample on the law."
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a measure to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organised in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote on my text or I keep full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons, substitute members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted on were unanimous.
Commentators are amused, on the other hand, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all eyes, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals denounce it as hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called upon to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulema but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to what they were during the previous regime.
Another sticking point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts, as called for by human rights associations, be prohibited.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy persists and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to appear on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
IDA identified the top five reasons to visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal font" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the turning of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the full nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Way of the Cross or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Antony, the Praetorium, where the judgment was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the Christian navel symbolic of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the spot where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews, the Western Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will later come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 BC. C. for your family.
They are located on mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, only those who dedicate themselves to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Up there, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, at the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of old Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth stopping by the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Bless you
Israel's three main tourist areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to undergo courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not advisable to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged into shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
It's actually from an underground funicular.
Travelling on any type of public transport costs NIS 6 and for this price you can travel by changing for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport disrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
On the streets of Israeli cities you do not see stray dogs.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, which comes out for $ 15 a day.
And renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of NIS 30.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% the same rate of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Big and Mighty" Will Take You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that the law would bring on the mandatory examination, scammers have already appeared in the country who trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
A law has been in force since 1 December, according to which every working immigrant must take an exam to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language test, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions.
Persons who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law went into effect, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually do?
What changes will the obligatory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First of all, answer the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labor migrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Immigration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must be initiated before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will be able to solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the would-be immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put him on a "paid trip" to a creepy, narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him languish for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajik Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, little boss!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone dress them, put them on shoes and buy them for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, when it comes to language law, rights advocates make an important point.
The tests will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money - from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several "fake" certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise migrant workers who would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Home Office fails to clamp down on illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, in which Apretar seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a gun license from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on gun ownership will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "iron fist policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be desisted from.
The percentage of recorded acts of vandalism with the use of weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told Russia's BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 there were 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of illegal arms proliferation is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market for weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High General Staff.
Screenshot of website accepting gun orders
The first, "vestige of the army or military", that is, weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by Caucasians themselves," Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were deliberately set to cover the lack," says a former soldier.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers are also doing their bit.
"Now private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market have proliferated and distribute weapons under the roof to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
One more source of the black market is contraband.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former soldier.
Where do guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and publicly accessible data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk at one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a batch.
Through an ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the registry and pass it over the fence.
"He takes the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two magazines," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers," adds the clerk.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed that I go to the "Begovaya" platform, where a man would take me to a "little corner" where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are vendors, but there you also have to arrive, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had lost a tooth."
I can even get a pair of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to betray him.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was put to the test of the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was "not everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, in the words of Baranets, is not offered a cat for a hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; We go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes."
For this, no documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buy a pistol or a machine gun."
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I buy TT pistol. Moscow," laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and catches with two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia.
military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People place orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions so that he knows where the weapon is hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Arms".
Viktor Baranets claims that if you order online, you run out of guns and are put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and catches with two hands those who wish to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish, to bait, and then to mine coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
On the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from military warehouses by mid-ranking chiefs.
According to the ministry's official statistics, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, to 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast-food and supermarket employees strike in the U.S.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and tame in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to increasing the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of labor unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has been practically not occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." On that day, the United States began the of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, walked off their jobs and picketed in protest alongside unions and left-wing activists at the corporation's stores, whose products target people of modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase of salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the median wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart's supporters are pleased to comment that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any losses to the corporation.
"Black Friday" ran in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that "fewer than five" Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations stunt," organized by the labor union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely the Walmart department store (which in this progressive city does not appreciate them, and that is why for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and you don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $ 8.90 per hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers stopped by McDonald's and worked there, behind counters, part-time after school, though they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this wage, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's at 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing labor movement activists with chicanery and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive turnover of staff.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place halfway through the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular the city's City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said "we must support fast-food workers to receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As described by the New York Times, this has been the largest such demonstration in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to spark a mass movement.
"For now, tricking the brain is not so easy"
The subject of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the company's scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
Even though Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
We must free the world of computing to ours, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it cannot be considered a panacea, the privacy issue remains to be resolved, since we do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- That is, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; This gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
An equivalent of such a device would be very useful for my work, but it does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible tuning fork sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play around with the location curvature of the cameras, and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could go from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (private things only you can see), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There's a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there's no tactile response!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand in support quality for the image.
Register touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to what one feels if someone were blowing on the fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here hides another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those in gyms), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, tricking the brain is not so easy, there is still work to be done for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, who are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Avant-garde of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front of them, at the forefront of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of St. Petersburg's art and scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always draw crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde St. Petersburg of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organ grinder of St. Petersburg, since it has matured to make such a difficult role, for its bohemian existence, its philosophy and its image.
- Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand that you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I made friends with artists of the new wave, with those after those who were exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I immersed myself in the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - For me it was important to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the home of St. Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought "Van Gogh's Ear" to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight trousers, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-Galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; He received basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, thus ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uneducated.
- There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the actuality and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, orienting oneself on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps that person should not even shake hands, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- Recently we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons others.
Now everyone has been divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to be liked by everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they arrive by the thousands!
- The abandoned go to see it, there works the sex-social sphere.
And 300 people go to a cultural event, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which usually people end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: civil servant of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones everything was different, kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to correctly evaluate them and pave the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is negligible.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
To conserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophile.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get as a result a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks did somersaults at random.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we got the chicks to hatch, but then we left because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "mini-arch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was passed by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could tell: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only one year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We are few, there are few astronauts to whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation has been growing.
"And if more can be said, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in preparation for flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, although still hostile, environment, for a newborn child it is his natal element.
The small amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on land arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, because it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath pass only 2 weeks.
"This is too little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swim instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles are decrepitated very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valery Polyakov asks himself this original question.
Moreover, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the organism does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally maladjusted person," predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, in time this will be a reality, when humans in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is weak.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, deputy chairman of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," is how he describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or demand obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, within the framework of which the legislation concerning public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started carrying out about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulates how public contracts should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and, then, the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet ended, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is confirmed, therefore, that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely common control of this kind that could help us to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which doesn't always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But the fact of reducing the limit of the awards does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized in another way?
As for offices, such as NKU, where the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) operates, with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The competences are also to some extent analytical, but while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of auditors are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities there, in Germany, are controlled at the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it is not possible to say exactly where it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
That certainly not, but, I repeat, I do not like to make this kind of comparison.
It needs to be said that even those countries we take as a model have to face a large number of problems.
If this were not the case, it would not be in their interest to collaborate with our office, don't you think?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your Office? Does its impact manifest itself in any way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet manifested itself in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, there is a certain need for a certain delay.
For now, it can be seen in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool for "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar are rectified.
Do you consider that the approval of this law is beneficial or, rather, that it represents a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope that it will be so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations "tighten" and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to toughen the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no bearing on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this path taken us.
The prime minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the "švarc" system banned or permitted?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say, "We changed the law and we allowed it," but you can't say we'll do business as usual.
In the law on public procurement, the regulations are quite strict as to how formal action should be taken. And that's how it needs to be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded because he does not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This, in my opinion, is what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads have ice and snow sheets.
Although most roads are passable, in some you should exercise extreme caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but had ice and snow patches.
The temperature drops and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the crests of the Ore Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor because of fog, according to information from the region's road operations control center.
The R6 expressway and top-notch road in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
Likewise, all second- and third-category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still sections with traces of ice and rammed snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in higher elevations.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Directorate of Roads and Motorways on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second- and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of rammed snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be clear to partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and one degree positive, a weak wind will blow.
Plzeň Region
The roads in the Plzeň region are passable this morning, although extreme caution will have to be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the road operations control center of the region.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-rate roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice sheets.
The second and third category roads are wet, so, in this case, there is also a warning of sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less traveled roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher elevations of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, snow still remained in the port of Červenohorské and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Road workers cleared snow overnight; About three centimetres of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are traces of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will encounter half-discarded snow in the direction of Jeseník," an operator from the Šumper road administration told ČTK today.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are passable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Road operators in northern Bohemia reported complications on different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below freezing, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech Massif Central, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
At present, no service complications have been reported.
Road operators have warned of ice around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the main roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of trees that had arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarmist news we like to cling to.
The Tap Tap band likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain that to our readers?
This is a state charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar declared for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key chains against the end of the world that can be purchased in www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled "End of the world, canceled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at benefit concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
It will be sung by all performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the music video, where Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We even work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world go to?
A fitting out for the barrier-free Studeo school, which we are completing in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The pupils of the school in Jedličkův ústav are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
Within the framework of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not so difficult how it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments ...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the East, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still not common for a person to move alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematize the problems of people with disabilities.
In what respects should we take an example from more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a severe disability to move on their own in public and can go to the toilet, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, everything will begin to really change.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not arrive until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to aid from the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something can be done differently.
Show business is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is received with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not only an advance for them, but for society as a whole.
Did it help that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe to you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they find out that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, you can't help it.
Those who have the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will involve 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to jointly sing the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The aim of the agreement is to raise the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the barrier-free STUDEO educational centre in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, which costs CZK 25 million.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the advance sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At last week's meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country from the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters on the far side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresina was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for starting the dresine or for braking.
The information about this dresina is limited to that collected in the press of the time.
From 1933 Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, the society is referred to for the first time with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, he proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the MR (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) sounding rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket on which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 work was suspended.
The successor to the first rockets of the RM type was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
On the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, on the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and on the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social traabajos law.
The resolution aroused a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "causes a drop" in the price of the competitor with the aim of taking over most of the market and, in this way, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily grows.
All this situation favors the total disinterest of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damages they have caused in their eagerness to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population and, in this way, attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own people without regard for social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of financial obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labor rights.
The result is growing poverty along with widening gaps between rich and poor.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid has now reached one million.
Within the framework of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
Such a scandal concerning the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The cost-saving measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live on a terrible salary at the edge of society, in the hope that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its egoism the political march and, therefore, the entire state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, entrust the drafting of laws to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like that described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had long been disintegrating and the administrations were occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unimpeded and people went to the polls with their votes given beforehand." "There were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls." "It began to be seriously talked about that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man." Although Appiános thought of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, with no effort to reform it thoroughly.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favor of a liberal type of democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that today's elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
The suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on Israel's side, argues for the right of self-defense and pigeonholes Palestinians into the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and labels Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the massacres that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, a look to discover who is profiting from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of power struggles is in the front row.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Naturally.
In the 90s of the nineteenth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that they would stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack in Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds' Bank of America central bank, began printing money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of triggering crises and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I as a result, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were no longer necessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to covertly create a conflict situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for them to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to the culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which lit the flame and provoked the outbreak of war.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the Arab population of Palestine began.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him in the beginning or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to how war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers succeeded in initiating it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Take for example how sharply divided Israel's supporters and detractors are divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where does injustice beget injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of it all there was the greed of some individuals and their lust for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz,  Where 20% of all the world's oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are David Rockefeller's words spoken in 1994 now shown: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"And it obliges everyone, young and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers in its name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, let him add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person, and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohammed Réza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the United States. The U.S., which had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive prospects: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, since, if it did, it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was subsequently further intensified by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which a covert story helped an extravagant point: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew that examined the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example can be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film, moods are combined. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences from Tehran. The credits sequence shows emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; There are not many differences in this respect.
On the other, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone ...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which the action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Likewise, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is "rolling" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the more intriguing scenes.
And he manages pretty well. Sometimes it adds something to reality: everything doesn't turn out so elegantly here (the scene in which the crisis lurks at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its trail become madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, assess its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But for it to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the secret services' notions of omnipresence and omniscience can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women took advantage of better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; Another ban is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline on the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticised.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, vindicates the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU should be at least 14 centimeters long and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize national standards not homogenized to date, which only complicated their marketing.
Rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the grounds that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year's EU prescription that inflatable balloons that are marketed are mandatory to warn that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction on the use of mother-in-law by children up to the age of 14 is also in place.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European civil servants: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensibilities of Greece, we must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies on the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Subsequently, for example, the Czech Republic exceeded the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which resulted in a threat of a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we don't have sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued this with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from landlocked countries.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member states' guidelines are often criticised, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which member states have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also struck a chord, in the same way as other countries of the Union, by fighting for the right to a designation of origin for their traditional products, even though our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc cottage cheese, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, along with feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, marzipan from the German city Lübeck or ham from Parma, there are already for example the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Pohořelice and Třeboň and even the hop variety of Žatec.
As protected EU maras, they can be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and the wafers of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything went well in our country, then I would not present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and the retirement age are increased.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
He has already arrived in the Senate, but soon after he has set out on his way to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I said that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not function; The function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate change.
To this are added the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
To do this, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobby group for the profession of guide to be recognized as autonomous work, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have the greatest potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholing or party dogma, I have the ability to be able to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
For me it doesn't matter, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don't care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDG and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
You are joking when you are said to be a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, all that remains are slogans.
And with that it cannot survive in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to do my part to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character who points out disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I'm just starting out in politics and trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things done myself, but if it doesn't go well, in six years' time I will quit and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that with one person I do nothing, that is why I have visited a series of well-known personalities, in case maybe they dare to present their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had too much work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I came forward on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
The people elected the Senate, so it will be difficult to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the unblemished past of every potential party member, nor do I have any money.
I have no money even for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
No money?
You talk about property statements, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream from my youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there isn't too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign out of pocket.
Campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't make a living from it. For example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son for English school, which costs SEK 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run for office.
So you will continue with your business activity to be able to live?
Didn't you say earlier that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As promised, I have partly stopped my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still earn.
If I were president, then I would leave business.

The architecture studio MVRDV proves that real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing by on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company near the library, says: "The building is also beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
No one enters those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town at the gates of Rotterdam that is barely worth a brief visit, holds the dubious honour of having won a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges that are represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was that policymakers decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for funny and cynical buildings, took the subject with her usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smile on her face.
And as the jury looked around puzzled and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens,
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'".
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros rises in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and semi-detached buildings.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white façade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to encompass with the view, the annealed brick floor and the elegant lampposts unmistakably support the public condition of the library.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park benches, dogs and children playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Usually the bookshelves are arranged along the façade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from farming.
For many years, greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands have used a plastic fabric a few millimetres thick as a base for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This thin tissue lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until obtaining plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located transversely to the glass façade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde also visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; It currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has penetrated deeply.
The shelves are full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even if it's only there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved success in that queen discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated she may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer state status at the United Nations.
However, Berlin eventually abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the country's special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is now reorienting its foreign policy, away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still testing what their role will be, but they have already started down the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean concretely from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not attach so much importance to it since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
They do, however, play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps in doing so Germany has managed to gain a certain respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has been clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities because of American domestic politics.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend this position in public.
I believe that the real disparity of opinion does not really have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must drive things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, whether simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky issue.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of a major international player? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or perhaps he still finds it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a major player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and that is that nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a globally known brand and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be proved right.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in copyright violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my desk.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters in order to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions when it comes to copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the cases of Pattloch are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to profit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
"It's bad for business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is in tatters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millions, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euros per year China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The processes can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had elapsed that the name that was the subject of the lawsuit had already become a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, they may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the plaintiff's trademark in China," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially used a white-and-blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to amend it.
Clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have struggled due to equipment and staffing shortages.
Last year, however, "the labor emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain outstanding.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are staggering.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, they reportedly pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in royalties.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg demonstrates.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting a Chinese impersonator in court.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the impersonator has managed to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because surnames are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the next two instances they have proved Freudenberg right, but the opposing side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the issue favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; The business archive has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing side a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
specifically whether imitators secure rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial area, but managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international legislation on trademark rights, but what must be done is "to also register in China everything that may be eligible for protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the theme can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party licensing fees by name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes and loafers look for the beat on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost go out of his way by trying to bring order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers have also arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors for the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni in Germany.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you one hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegyrist" in Zulu.
In this room no one can speak fluently this Bantu language, but they do know how to sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and lowest life expectancies worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of infection, is not welcomed by the population.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their thirties has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this secluded village, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
In the beginning it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
STDs of bacterial origin include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15-25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were reported in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can lead to ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore go undetected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they manage to raise quite a bit of money.
"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village Zodwa Dlamini itself, a confident and leadership woman manages the money sent from Germany.
She sees to it that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos," as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite how obvious this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's about sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle full of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one place to another and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "You can get free condoms on any street corner, but they are hardly used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; So much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear a couple of tears from the occasional rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town hardly appears on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, the light shines there," says the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the pace, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also water ice there, as can be seen from three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow an ice sheet has formed.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger chief investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images back to Earth: tiny windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet."
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult thing to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent image of an endangered star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars form from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters," are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of astronomy's great unknowns.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carom: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other to end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light years away is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, dubbed Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continually arise; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this very bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers surmise that it formed shortly after the big bang, when mostly hydrogen could be found in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
It allows observing the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
It is not expected to be able to take images until 2018.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them scans the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes to us from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope searches for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the last preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is also ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no hard evidence, since the Messenger probe orbits the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements point to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan many people manage to reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus makes its way with a bang through the winding road that passes by wooded hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is located in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of whom not much is known, apart from the fact that they perfectly master Persian and Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists hardly reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheepherder Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies this.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. She apparently still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
So has Şirali Müslümov been wrong in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registry either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what is typical in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two small children also jump back and forth.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in typical glasses with a domed shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son proudly discovers.
I have always washed my hair with milk, that's why it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I have never gone shopping in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything got back on track when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult professed of the paternal figure of the nation, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over the baton to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount that can be lived on well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray-haired son is right: "In our culture elders are highly respected."
They live in a big family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The term "Human Rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired.
The future constitution, based on sharia, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
All of them, hopelessly mired in confused opposition until now, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Is it intended to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour evening meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that "principles" mean?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway that goes with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all of Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to be this way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To put it bluntly, it is nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another forbids offending or slandering Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it is to be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation prohibiting "offending persons."
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks, the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the Islamists' superiority.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Caryo's Square and vowed to derail the Act before it can take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution should be "in the dustbin of history."
On Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it shouting: "the people demand the application of divine law."
They demanded Morsi "clean up the country," while proclaiming, "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have led to a situation akin to a civil war.
Clearly, Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing happening.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters of it would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should take.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists' draft is guaranteed a majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'human rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," he lamented in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three branches of government made this lawyer resign himself.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could backfire.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the smelliest fish in the world?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has anything to do with its greed for smelly fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and damp football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The scenery is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets dark and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this most captivating, so to speak, delicacy.
"You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit in one gulp," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk," who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking significant amounts of the drink in one gulp.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it's not bad; It's not unlike a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty plagued Norway and when, before refrigeration, fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, migrating mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; More than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive social services system.
A stream of inhabitants from Sweden, the old rival and until not too long ago much richer than Norway, come to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, if rather smelly, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A beer rod or sandwich costs you a whopping €10 ($14) each.
Norway is not usually on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still reluctant to utter the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who gunned down and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 event."
Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth is the growth, since the early 70s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she passes trays of rakfisk and, with her long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, prudent people."
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; All but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have during the years leading up to the worldwide financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tightly shut.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a burst of laughter.
I'm in the snow queuing up to eat something; I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that smelly fish returns.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A live television has connected with a presenter wearing a bow tie and surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a rough start
As Mexico's incoming president, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and assume the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been performing well economically during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My administration has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before rubbing shoulders with the U.S. president, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A highly populous and fast-growing state surrounding the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and potholed roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will succeed in making real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy from Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Particularly, when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's description of the lack of essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen."
On the other side of the state, however, that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called upon to intervene to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately notorious for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to struggle to hold back tears as she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got to his house, it looked as if his body had been cleaned," Ms. Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother recounts the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross on which a single word is read: Justice.
Yet that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up."
"But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has vowed to prioritize them during his term.
"I hope he's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
Yet that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning Failed to Report Wrongdoing, Prosecutors Say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning during his time in prison
Trial focuses on Manning's stint at Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors sought to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution's questioning of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, U.S. Attorney Major Ashden Fein said records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no allegation about his treatment.
The questioning, which took place during a hearing following the defense's request to dismiss the case on the grounds that his imprisonment had been harsh and that it had already been sufficiently punished, came a day after Manning had testified that he had contemplated suicide while in detention.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was held in maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers reportedly asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to him by the guards as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional."
The forms do not show any allegations of mistreatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about her treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that visiting officers had discussed those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'no incident' (after talking about the issues) but this doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any issues," Manning said.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she was receiving during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he found himself.
The military said he had been placed under the restrictive regime, which is one grade below that of possible suicide watch, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the general staff to know that I was OK and (wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was just reduced to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointed at his eyes as he slept.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday's deposition that after he was forced to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that she had never been given the opportunity to cover herself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's questioning Friday, Manning said she deduced from the guard's order that she drop the blanket she could have covered herself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered her to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning said she had told the officer she could have used the elastic on her underwear or flip-flops to harm herself but had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take into account his experiences during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he were convicted at the court-martial, which is due to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held under the rules applicable to any detainee in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, unlawfully provoking the posting of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; He says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely walked down the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Signs indicated the way to two lines: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners."
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
This is ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian."
Later I decided on "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and stood in line for foreigners.
I thought back to that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, were: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is now as likely to stay in Mexico as he is to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And Montezuma's sons are put on a war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that is really challenging is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, although we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican dream.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as if we are from an inferior category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter are bothered by this.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate matters, from what I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and press political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, right...
That's not going to happen.
There is too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated far less time ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the usual futile discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their long-standing conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in tatters whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that its deadly stalemate could run aground.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 holds, this week's clashes have bolstered hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has taken a heavy beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and straining Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has been unable to finish off Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced Hamas' cause. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Jubilant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah party-militia dominates, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Particularly on Israel's southern flank, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas' first cousin and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military question is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep more peacefully... for some time.
On diplomacy, the United States is more assertive than ever; Many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
First and foremost, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to swell even though,  According to international law, they are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even more hardline group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to elections on January 22, is in a good position.
Why pamper those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculus.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere may not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area's superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire bodes well and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis, too, should think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The crackdown is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two or three years to repel Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outsiders.
The solution remains the one touted by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the flow of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain virtual statehood at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is in the vital interest of the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Tobacco plain packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases are displayed on dull green packs, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australia's world-first tobacco and plain packaging law comes into force and replaces brand logos and colours with a dull olive green wrapper, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies sick as children of smoking parents.
Except for the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the brand names, all of them printed in a small font.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
Australia's federal government claims the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit glamorous.
He relies on studies that show that if a person hasn't started smoking before age 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never do it.
"You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said U.S. Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market in tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco brought in by counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover up the unpleasant images on packs had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's High Court.
Ms Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stock.
"It's good business for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to display cigarettes, tobacco marketing has shifted to online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman saw an increase in brand reviews from "ordinary citizens" posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You wonder if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it.
Australia's British American Tobacco said the industry is focusing more on what the new regulations entail than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; these countries are claiming before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a ruling in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce mandatory images on packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are defiant.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"You take the cigarette and put the package away," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit: because of my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, says the uniform packs make it harder for him to put them on shelves.
"It usually took an hour to clear a delivery; now it takes four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we closed the store," he says, raising his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During the Thanksgiving holidays this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not forgetting duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is okay for both us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Being bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we cheerfully accept boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, this is not the case.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating back to the first century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and pitching the idea to a 100-person focus group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wanting, but not being able to, engage in an activity that fulfills you."
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom may sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be theirs.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the next room to an unrelated TV program at full volume, others listened to it with the volume low, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the show with the volume low showed more boredom than the other two groups; They struggled to concentrate, but they weren't sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you're trying to focus on a difficult or interesting task, impaired attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like spotting defective parts on a manufacturing line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person more physically alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: a plane delay, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 80s a "boredom tendency scale".
The scale includes questions such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do it all".
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day using a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom peaks," largely because both children and teens aren't given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
"Boredom is your brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they may not be bored anymore, but they won't have learned to entertain themselves or dose themselves," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Not only does your child learn to entertain himself, but he learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"The way we see it, we need to get bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate to something worthwhile," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Use Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community high school student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal statewide: possession of marijuana rocks and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar on the plains near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors each carrying a $100 fine) informing him of the trial date.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those 21 and older for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's more conservative district attorneys have vowed to move forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to block newly licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This is all changing so rapidly that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also mulling the issue.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing; All this before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us," he says.
Washington's law, dubbed I-502, takes effect Dec. 6, leaving also a year during which you will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to balance the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to licensed marijuana and its prohibition on conducting cannabis business within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metro area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On Nov. 21, Oates, Aurora's police chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city's attorney would stop prosecuting minor offenses for possession of marijuana by people 21 and older and that police would stop filing charges against those crimes "effective immediately."
Police Chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city's regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In northern Colorado's Weld County, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a narrower view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure users into treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, though many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those offenses that at the time they occurred were crimes," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county's district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until the law changes," he said.
Despite 55 percent of voters supporting the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and judicial system was never considered to be easy.
The mixed reactions across the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials about the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier with the district attorneys," says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana possession defendants who is a local spokesman for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They've spent so much time taking people to court that they still can't accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the nationwide test cases for drug legalization.
As lawyers and state officials count on a new frontier of legal sales, they are also eagerly awaiting directions from the federal government, which still envisions the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful the Justice Department will relent.
Although there have been some high-profile arrests of patients and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has mostly allowed businesses selling marijuana for medical purposes to exist in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While drug enforcement officials likely won't knock down doors to seize a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law, to operate," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking for what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory"
University students are not attacked for their views only now
I can't remember a time in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had been to what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary Greek symposium that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 80s to study history, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and burst into tears.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had dropped out because I did not tolerate some university classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I was leaving because I was forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my quirky name, nor the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the so-called enlightenment was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a leading adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may wonder what that is coming to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of Conservative Party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them called for the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's JCR say they are "often seriously ostracized, personally attacked and treated as persona non grata" for their political views.
They want to create a seat on their college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their plight was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which portrayed the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former chairman of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and a cane with a silver hilt.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-chairman of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student in Corpus Christi who introduced the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one o'clock.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at an all-time high.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an "honoris causa" degree following cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with horror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students get to know each other and get to know the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative university students, but participated in it willingly.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminary.
The first one I attended had to translate eighteenth-century French texts into English and I wasn't prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't give a single one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like sponge cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Are the Thatcherites refusing to learn French or are they just dumb?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes burned with the tears I was trying to hold back.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt growled.
I returned to my room like a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college. Then I felt a light pat on the back.
He was a sophomore English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how things go.
They mess with anyone who is suspected of being a Tory.
For me it is very complicated, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many newcomer Tories appear to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to disguise.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved futile.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated."
Other students adopted that little song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat up each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the '60s.
Could I one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I become Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History at my college.
They hated him for being not only from the Conservative party, but also Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was barely around.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40s, all political points of view were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreaming needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
Her sore eyes began to blur.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you left him."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to the pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar where another history professor had insinuated, quite seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with embarrassment inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men."
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was inside curled up in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Perhaps you will call me weak weepers.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 Conservative party prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Couture", an apotheosic retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos with the signature of the best of the aristocracy abound, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows those personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't put out their cigarette butts on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his flat.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything you could see and feel its spirit.
"He made each of the guests feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-meter-long catwalk that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to contemplate a dreamy "audience" that sports Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis,  the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of being old enough and the occasion to be able to wear one of his evening gowns...
The time finally came in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flew skirt, draped corsage and neckline word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her couturier's party dresses with "the utmost care... Because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it entails."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory-colored silk suit inlaid with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of haute couture in the late twentieth century, "the return of high society clients."
Obfuscated for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now its best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"I've always been struck by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was spotless, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says it...
The toughest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After pulling up large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters in altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend at a snail's pace, keeping their balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall off the cliff.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell years ago on the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once up, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, carrying the heavy baskets wearily, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As it is normal to carry 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three daily postages.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a pittance for such an inhumane effort, it is triple what he would earn on the field.
"The miners' wages are very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," clarifies the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the pit was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a compelling reason that, in Indonesia, is as forceful as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus,  and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, is struggling to breathe, coughs constantly and has irritated eyes from toxic fumes
At 27, Anto has been playing his skin for three years in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes heavily, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases given off by the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs or supply any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and with both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that, together with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the beasts and not for the people," protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complain of suffering serious illnesses ... Beyond, of course, his usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and shoulder sores, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions pluck 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a goat road through the undergrowth.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of their five children, the eldest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: the one done by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let's fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of an advertisement for mints, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty."
This is purely internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one that doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and doles out tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its leaders' conservatism and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 — known as the replenishment rate — was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a declining birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, websites abound with thinly disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, whom they criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unintended consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-run homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that drives sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hindered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district it looks like they're not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off," says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their career, stress, and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the final say.
The private off line is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or "the field of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under 16?
How do you apply this definition in your everyday life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by airing situations on the Internet that you surely would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the password and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't upload to a post," says ten-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone," he says.
On FB I upload beautiful or game images.
I also entertain myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or of someone who's making a fool of themselves," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he listen to someone recommending him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, none of them have suggested to him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressure me or demand it, I just take them out of my account," he acknowledges.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of my friend was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," she says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close the account.
"He just put privacy on it."
It then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes I would, if I don't like it or I feel like it.
"Even though I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity is not enough for that."
"Also that they are selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Below, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"One acts offline with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be in social networks," he says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read social media policies thoroughly.
By understanding each of the subparagraphs, they have a solid foundation to talk with their children about the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or posted," he says.
According to Guardia, it's key to remind children of the lesson to "don't talk to strangers."
Unasur Summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without making public the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially said that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later said that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was transmitted in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated either.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that transmission systems were secured for all journalists but limited the collection of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Court of The Hague that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the ruling that defines the differences that we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and shook hands with Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence."
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to low-cost internet in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The outcome document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after a ruling by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible that he will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are expected to meet Saturday in Mexico where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of that country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state-run TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish South American citizenship that the member countries of Unasur encourage.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers through any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because it has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice for requiring him to submit in his territory to interrogation for an alleged sexual crime when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
What there is is the danger of deteriorating their physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safeguard that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances," he said.
And he said that "if Great Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem ends.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and clarified that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists for profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador," and said that if he is re-elected "he will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the correct direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état clothed in legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that ruling is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
You have to process them broadly to overcome them and move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary litigation between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries agree to accept a ruling, however harsh it may be."
In reference to the eventuality that he presents himself as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause for late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: AIDS positive.
"It was as if a bomb fell on me," he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; With such determination that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG.  Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users:  up to 30 years with a CD4 count and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that whoever receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as he remains in control he will be able to live without problems until he is 75 years old," explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May of this year; However, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not one of access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, detection tests have to be offered massively, to all people who require it. "
In his proposal specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) coincide, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested at a private laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma.  A cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better blow myself three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was for the better, I eat well, I exercise, I take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle slogan against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV cause.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among those most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with derision and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, said the communicator.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; That condoms are not only behind the counters and those hundred are in public toilet dispatchers in the places that young people frequent.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"That's not how sexuality is, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a US appeals court a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through a commercial contest in Mexico, the scenario places a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, then, that the procedures in guarantee of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the accolade to the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of seizure of their properties in beyond El Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding is the commercial contest processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on Uniformity in International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the bankruptcy the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
The truth, in addition, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the Courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to avoid the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country.
For the time being, the firm of the González Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of the latter, that is, the five magistrates, since only three voted.
If this is not successful, the appeal of Cerciorare will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of Commercial Contests, pointing out that he vented in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the States United.
Moreover, it is noted that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two bands: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
Balance Sheet
Dormant for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General's Office on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from trust F/589 of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surround the Dragon Mart
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members in general of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental arena that devastated part of protected areas and poses the mother of all threats against the industry.
ACTA died
Ignored by the government a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already gone to the file.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the housing developer Homex is placing stock certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
Made up of the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the name Competival has just been born, whose objective will be the services market of the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investments in the area exceed 1.5 trillion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Globetrotters of basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was linked to the sport of the plank for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have such a broad mental collection of local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federation president during the 90s," Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are those that recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years serving as a co-attorney or proxy of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, either as a proxy, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's BSN debut year.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had coached here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have you a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was native and was one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already a federative boss.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the Olympic Qualifier in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and should have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group from the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
It is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave the U.S. team a fight, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Olympic Qualifier in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the mess of the Pan American of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What was left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponce only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What do you do now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. for a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the parent company of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when she died at a Dallas hospital, her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to everyone he met.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, caring and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995 he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his house.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly obnoxious J.R. that propelled Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate excitement around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars in bookmakers.
He also helped give the series a ratings record at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second-most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the 1983 finale of "MASH," which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had motives to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and a cheating husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off screen."
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the episodes for the second season and a sixth was in process, the network reported.
There was no immediate pronouncement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she had it in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "fear not, it will be a little awkward for a short time, but you're going to be okay."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Course that explores the "End of the World" begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "debtrmagedon," and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If you look at what's been happening in the world today as if we're 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what's possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On Penn State's main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only "The End of the World."
"We didn't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "impending ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of Revelation, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-grade students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, on the other hand, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology major from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing major, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a teacher — said they believed the Dec. 21 expiration date.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we kind of debunked it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key item on the calendar, Restall said.
But he said there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"Elsewhere people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a La Salle University religion professor who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew of any courses on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many doomsday days, saying that if nothing happens on Dec. 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that Dec. 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to parties "at the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends to have a laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
