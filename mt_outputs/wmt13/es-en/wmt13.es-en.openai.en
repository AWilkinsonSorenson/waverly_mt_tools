A Republican strategy to impede Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers this latter a myth and asserts that voter fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from being struck by lightning.
en: In fact, Republican lawyers have found only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new regulations will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
In line with this, most American governments passed new laws from 2009 onwards making it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, in 2011, 180 bills were introduced that restricted the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
en: Furthermore, those laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and remove the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to require it.
The United States Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
Therefore, Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bill proposals in 34 states to require voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal form of identification, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any form of government-issued photo ID in their state.
English: On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identification document with those characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required identification document costs more than one hundred dollars.
Therefore, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and those with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000 per year, 18% of citizens over 65 years old, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who most vote for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
Furthermore, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who typically vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
en Arizona was the first state to implement such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are US citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit Hispanic voting.
It appears that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished same-day voter registration in eight states.
en: Furthermore, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create an assistance service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
Additionally, Republican legislators passed laws in five other states that favored reducing the early voting period.
In the 2008 elections in Florida, for example, 33% of early voters were African American, while they only represented 13% of the state's electorate.
Spanish: En el caso de los hispanos, ocurría exactamente lo mismo.
These represent only 11% of the voters, which amounts to 24% of the citizens who vote early.
However, whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, only represent 46% of the citizens who voted early.
English: Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several pieces of legislation.
The United States Department of Justice intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, to some extent, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these system-wide legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new regulations will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will undermine the American democratic system in part.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Should I Get Tested or Not?
Indeed, the PSA test can sometimes produce inaccurate results, with false negatives or even false positives, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reticent by nature, doubt whether they should or should not take the screening tests.
Should I take the test or not?
We have sought advice from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of infection was detected among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
en: The European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had undergone screening and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up of 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of developing metastasis if the screening test has not been done.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
African American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. All possible options should be offered and prostate cancers that do not pose a long-term threat to life should not necessarily be treated, in which case active surveillance of the disease should be chosen instead.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since the cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their life.
We suggest active monitoring of the disease instead, and if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine if you should get the test or not.
Movember has collaborated with the International Society of Urology to create a tool that allows for evaluating the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of getting the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
English: "If nobody smoked, that rate would at least increase by 50%,” emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
We estimate that around 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It hugely harms people's health.
en: Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec, said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
An encouraging statistic: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Obesity and being overweight also increase the risk of disease, according to the SCC.
The risks of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancer are increasing.
en: Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer, they add.
Food
The organism recommends limiting the consumption of red meats as well.
In large amounts, they increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Deli meats should also be avoided.
Meat preservation for smoking, drying, or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
They explain to us that it can damage the cells of the organism and lead to the development of cancer.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
According to the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them showed a decrease in prostate cancer risks, the other one showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been able to be determined clearly.
en: Furthermore, M. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of discussing one's worries and family background with their doctor.
Taking the screening test does not cause cancer.
The Higgs Boson in Detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a great stir last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, indeed, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model: our best or "least bad" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter, which has yet to be empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Additionally, new data revealed this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is needed to be completely sure.
en: We assume it is Higgs anyway, since the chances of being wrong seem slim. We will see what it is about.
Hey, in this great world, there is a widespread and unavoidable law that implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you will end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of this kind in it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
en: On one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And then there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, meaning they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Lab's Particle Adventure website, which is quite extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't discuss here, and the "force particles" through which the fundamental forces of nature are propagated and with which the Higgs boson is somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic creatures we might think.
Indeed, if you are able to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" which acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that immediate environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing other than a photon; that is, one of the bosons "force carriers".
Stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, extremely high energies are required, a bit like a frozen pond in which only a large rock could slide across the surface.
Therefore, an immense particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circumference ring!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never stay stuck to the door of a fridge by itself.
In the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what can all these researches contribute?, asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and SM predictions.
English: Meanwhile, many fervently wish that they will be found, as the smallest difference could open a door to a “new physics” that could patch up certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as not proposing any explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up around 80% of the matter in the Universe (another oops!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Consequences
The repercussions of such investigations on our daily lives are hard to predict, but we don't think we're wrong when we say there will be none.
To see: In the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would cause.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
Indeed, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was more of a "laboratory device".
Imagine...
And also, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light sensor in 1969 as part of his research in optics.
Despite it not being his original intention, this sensor now serves as the "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.

en: Palliative Care. The Best Way to Die... | Le Devoir
In its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
The Duty has tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Cancer of the prostate that was destroying him had given him a reprieve of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, but I've already been like this for seven," he recounts, withered away, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived at the day before.
en: "But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she continues.
The illness has wreaked havoc on him: a tremendous weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating by himself.
Sitting in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly accepts help to eat.
Brave, she even smiles, talks to strangers who pay her attention, bring her medicine and offer her a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
en: "My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confesses.
Later that day, the team found a remedy for the problem.
In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up,” relates Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
To go back to one's childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
en: "That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provide "curative" care.
Mrs. A.'s greatest fear, at 89 years old, is to die "conscious and suffocating".
But the illness has made him discover his children.
en: "I have good children," he adds.
She says, "I have no more wishes in this life," before accepting the mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the coming days, for one last visit from her son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois is offering, with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance with meals.
Palliative care is given when nothing else can be done.
To help make her passing more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all eventually die one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether it be on a physical, emotional, or spiritual level.
The dying are offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics are no longer monitored for their blood sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who passed away during the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
en: "We help both patients and their loved ones," reports Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
In Victor-Gadbois Center, days pass without ever being the same.
Beside a 94-year-old man savoring his last family gathering in the yard, comfortably nestled among his pillows while everyone toasts to his health, a 36-year-old tragically passes away surrounded by his parents, wife, and two children, having tried everything to survive.
For the past six months, there have been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years old suffering from cancer, worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois center come from their home and 47% come from the hospital.
Access to Palliative Care Problem
Seventy-seven percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to relieve suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital, or in a care facility.
Several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Home Palliative Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
The lack of adequate healthcare in Quebec is precisely what has many specialized palliative care doctors fearing the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care luminaries such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the healthcare system in Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has access to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the Emergency Room suffering from severe pain without anything being done to relieve her.
I fear that patients wish to die alone because they are not receiving the proper care.
At the same time, many oncologists remain dedicated to their patients until the very end, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard's hopes of survival were already at a minimum when she stopped an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to give up fighting, he recounts.
en: However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!
There are no all-powerful caretakers.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die are thankful to their caregivers for not having responded to their requests once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care in Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of their death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, untreated illness will have the possibility of having palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want to be relieved".
This report was made possible through a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Wide-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fundraisers, and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, unionists, and mafiosos.
en: An "industry" that became too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system crumbles once we've caught the big guys," quips Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outburst of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible through an in-depth investigation into the misappropriations linked to highway contracts in Quebec, which the then Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, the clandestine financing of political parties, and corruption among officials.
From the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transportation would have saved one billion dollars in contracts, containing some of its instincts to take a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," it adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the stratagems existing behind the individuals".
An anti-corruption permanent unit, established in 2011.
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, established in 2011, is also applied with its team of government auditors, investigators, and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "Squad Marteau", which, since 2009, have made the "Sewer Cartel" of Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
Over the past few weeks, the unit has been carrying out a series of investigations into fraud and corruption allegations against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a town on the outskirts.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who recently resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
It is suspected that multiple bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers of Montreal's road network and Italian-origin businessmen, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
This last one has caused shock when explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal for three years to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money left and right during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the ruling Liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising campaign for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewer contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption operated effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: over a ten-year period he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction sector companies totaling $736,000, all in exchange for contracts for sewerage work whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate invoices by between 30% and 40% for false extras.
Additionally, an organizer of the Mayor Martin Dumont's party accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, leading Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
Seventy percent of the money for election campaigns was dirty money.
From the research that will eventually be carried out, she ensures that she will "pull a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish out the culprits".
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning up the wounds but there is a need for a clean investigative unit in Montreal and to be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat.
How to do the cleaning.
Spanish: Regularmente.
Jacques Duchesneau stated that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is most concerned about the role of the "elected politicians aware of the scheme".
English: Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was used to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I have been told that this is only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit political party donations to $100, but that won't change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
Recommend a full review of the public contract awarding and party funding system: "We cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
en: "PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has taken on a new identity with PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I move forward day by day by your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
Those elements push me to raise the level of my game every day.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything moves very fast in football.
But I don't get worked up.
Since my start at INF Clairefontaine's training center to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have made giant strides.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruits of this summer are used to playing high-level games.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it my all.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti has been very helpful in terms of my positioning.
He is backed up by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man that the team needed?
en: Of course.
All coaches respect Ancelotti.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great deal of experience and has won numerous titles with the top clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think she will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The trust he has in me explains my good performance as well.
What do you think about PSG in the first half of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken away our top spot.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say against many and very good European teams.
We want, to start off, to finish first in our league against Porto in order to receive the return of the eighth-finals.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and be there for the long haul.
Today, that is not the case.
Economically, PSG is committed to its means to make this project a reality.
Would not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, be a huge failure?
en: Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that championship title.
We didn't get very far in the last season.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal for them to expect a lot from us if we consider what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home against Troyes, it is a bit frustrating that there are still things to be criticized.
We wonder what else people are expecting.
We will never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to get a game project off the ground.
Building a team takes time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, who after two seasons have failed to qualify for the knockout stages, and they have invested a lot too!
Given the amounts invested, we would expect you to have a 15 point lead at the end of the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not doing well last season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is thrilling.
I hope that by May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's just say we have a "Zlatandependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is very capable and he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to show that he is the star of League 1.
He has proven in every team he has been on that he is a great player, a world-class star.
We respect the man and the player in the group.
He also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to raise their game.
English: Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How have you experienced the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It has been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
We saw things there and left feeling strengthened.
Today I managed to play good games on the team.
en: It's what I've been expecting since my baptism with the "bleus".
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behavior today.
What is your vision of Didier Deschamps' first month in charge of the "bleus"?
He is getting results.
They are well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
en: Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the Euro Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the 1-1 draw on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a similar game throughout my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
en: The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between parties.
Additionally, as is often the case with technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
en: In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a convertible virtual currency to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows for peer-to-peer file sharing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
Approximately one thousand websites accept Bitcoin as donations or as a form of payment.
After reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, the Bitcoin rate dropped to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (rates are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
It's nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
en However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in an October report on virtual currencies.
In it, Bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
English: Bitcoin differs from other virtual currency systems such as "credits", used to progress in a video game and which can be earned by playing or bought (and sometimes even exchanged).
Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and handles the changes.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously bookkeepers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
en: How does that network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses.
English: A user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that Bitcoin changes are recorded in the public ledger, which is broadcast across the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that ledger.
This passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file slicing phase, that is, transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
en: Computers "grab" the new transaction and add a number before "breaking up" the set.
The goal is to find the number that provides a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once the number is found, the other nodes can easily verify that it is the correct one.
The transaction is then indelibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
Yes, if a user were to attempt to commit fraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would become orphaned, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge will get 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, that reward will be divided regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the hundred-millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in computing power.
The ups and downs of life on the network are already here.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins held in deposit have been stolen.
Pierre Noizat, who recently launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network, assures that "the bug used does not affect the same protocol".
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same drawback.
Heavyweight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that around 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, the "Giant Sales" were launched.
English:  "$30,000 was exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of an educational book on that currency, is quite confident in the potential of this technology as well as the transaction network.
Paytunia is their system, which is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, making them cheaper.
The carrier also manages their identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in stores, with no need to install new terminals or software.
All you need to provide is an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement towards replacing hierarchical systems with more horizontal systems.
It will take time for Bitcoin to become established, but there could be a shift in 2013, predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also foresees revaluating the various risks, currently considered high, should this currency be successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops have withdrawn from their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must withdraw by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their own future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished Afghan peasants in particular, whom we have deemed to be terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former leaders who are refugees in Pakistan, but often also local villagers who reject the presence of foreign troops, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
They will no longer be tolerated, or even sometimes aided by local insurgents, when the Westerners become more discreet.
I observed the departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which was made by order, from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to French credits.
The convoy of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul unharmed, watched over by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since its unstoppable advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood due to the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghans have paid the price for the ignorance of their rural population overwhelmed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation is not better today.
The elderly mujahideen, the current government, and the current Taliban all share a desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
In 2001, the main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power.
They have become speculators, taking over government land to resell as plots for the refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, according to what I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have experienced the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under 25 years old, Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are filled with both girls and boys.
We must give work to those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. Turkish television and its soap operas portraying a modern world have many admirers across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who wish to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are now concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some degree of decentralization, similar to Western nations. However, the United States has sought to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in relation to the upcoming elections in April 2014.
Despite this, their country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has resumed its services, no reservoir has been repaired and no important irrigation systems have been fixed.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except for fruits and vegetables.
Private initiative should take priority.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
That only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to take over.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the land and without means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
Chinese miners have almost completely abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports depend heavily, to restore normal relations.
The French troops departed on November 20th.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural fields, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to try to reconcile aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous collective interest works and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
Those jobs, eager to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultivation areas.
What will we leave behind as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A modest budget will contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are often very harsh in these valleys located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something the farmers have told me they desire, would require a small, well-controlled, and direct civil aid.
An Constitution by Forceps in Egypt
en: It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration granting him provisional full powers, he decided to go all in.
en: It took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Last week, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
It has been almost two years since Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been modified several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only served to widen the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "betray his word" and "tread on the law".
Supporters of the measure claim that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days a referendum should be organized.
A very short period of time forced the Brothers to abandon their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi appears confident that Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly magazine Time.
es:  Dado que este recurso fue votado con mucha rapidez, contiene un ultimátum para el pueblo egipcio: "o votan mi texto o mantengo los poderes plenos", poderes que supuestamente terminarán con la adopción de la Constitución.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In the middle of November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they thought they could not make their views heard.
Human rights advocates, religious minorities, and civil society representatives did the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted on have been unanimously.
Commentators find it amusing, on the other hand, that one of the few disagreements of the day was expressed almost at prayer time, so much so that several members of the committee even thought that the clock of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, were hoping that "principles" could be replaced by "rules", which would have allowed for a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals accuse it of hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
They claim that the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They are referring, in particular, to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, particularly for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is concerning because "the people called upon to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of the university would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
en: There is currently no specific religious implication.
With this Constitution, we are within the framework of civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
We are specifically referring to the term iqh (Islamic jurisprudence).
The question that might be asked in the future would be to what extent are civil judges competent to rule on all of this?
Beyond its religious character, the text voted on yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that they are few in comparison to those who were during the previous regime.
Another contentious issue: the powers granted to the military.
According to the military's wishes, the review of the Defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defense Council.
No processing of civilians in military courts will be prohibited either, as requested by human rights defense associations.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider to be oppressive.
Blasphemy remains a crime and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
She said the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture according to Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to appear on television last night, demonstrations are expected for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
Ukrainian tourists in Israel can expect the holy land, the navel of the world, and a sea of salt.
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Biblical truths with modern comforts and pristine nature.
en: "AIF" identified the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Respect in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pool" will receive divine grace.
In Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm, and the nets full of fish.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places can be found in Jerusalem.
English: Believers here walk the Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
Begin at Antonio Fortress, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continue through the streets of the Old City, go to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing and to the place of Jesus' burial.
Here also lies the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the spot where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was made.
In Jerusalem is also located the most sacred place for Jews, the Western Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to be built in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are located on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who practice climbing can reach there by their own means.
Others can reach this historic summit by funicular.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
en: Bus services are available from the foot of the hill up to there.
The total length of the ski trails is 45 km.
According to an old legend, pagan gods were supposedly living on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are around 300 museums.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But it's worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting ones.
The Israel Museum is among them, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It houses the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, and around 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In her painting exhibition she has canvases from Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, and Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Museum-Bath, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers from that era.
It is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli in Cesarea, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Entry is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, displays one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars shine.
They sound the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that people swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and people swim there all year round.
en: By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 meters below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain even those who don't know how to swim.
The landscapes of the surroundings are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Uncovering the mysteries of antiquity
The old part of Tel Aviv, the Jaffa Citadel, preserves it on the Mediterranean coast.
She was passed by the famous maritime route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here where Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, newlyweds couples can be found coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries, to have their photos taken.
In Cesarea, the city of King Herod, you can take a walk around the Roman theatre and explore the Crusader fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, remember!
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English is not very good: around 30% of the population speaks Russian in this country.
It is not advisable to take money for this trip in Euros, but in Dollars, which can easily be exchanged for Shekels (currently 1-3$,8 Shekels).
Urban transportation is mainly composed of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the country's only metro line, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
It's actually from an underground funicular.
It costs 6 shekels to travel on any type of public transport, and for this price you can transfer and travel for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturdays are celebrated as the Sabbath.
From Friday night until Saturday sunset, markets and stores close and public transportation stops working.
But Sunday morning marks the start of a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, only Kosher food is served, which excludes pork, shellfish, fish without scales, and dishes combining milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground chickpea balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities, no stray dogs can be seen.
In contrast, there are many well-fed cats that "roam at their own leisure" in an imposing manner.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Ronroneadores love crowded places and don't turn down treats.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
en: In addition to the insurance, which is $15 per day.
The rental of a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels per day.
The admission to museums costs an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine.
Ukrainian tourists visited The Promised Land from January to October 2012, amounting to 118,800, which is 51% higher than the same index in 2010 before the visa regime was cancelled on February 9th, 2011.
en: The great and powerful will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language.
While legislators and human rights advocates debate the consequences of the mandatory testing law, scammers selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have been stuck at home.
As of December 1st, a law will come into effect, according to which every working immigrant must take an exam to verify their knowledge of the Russian language.
English: This rule is currently applicable only to those intending to work in the service provision, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade sectors.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Additionally, it will not be enough to take the language exam, but also the Russian history exam and the fundamentals of legislation exam.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed in order to receive and renew a work permit.
Except for citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
en: Those who obtained their education certificates and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, Fatalism, and Defense of Rights
The network of testing centers will be sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take tests in all cities, currently over 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the test was supported by the State Duma deputies and the Federal Immigration Service.
But defenders of rights, long before the law came into effect, often managed to ask the press: What will this really bring?
What changes will the requirement of language knowledge bring for both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First of all, Immigration Service representatives answer, this will help reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people are talking today about the defense of the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will be able to resolve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Immigrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language or pass the medical exam have the problems.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev claims, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, will put him on a "paid trip" to a creepy and cramped shack, where he and dozens of others like him will be consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a multitude of complaints from our immigrants.
In their home country they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, their passports are taken away from them, and they are not paid the promised wages, confirms Tolib Sharipov, Head of the Labor Immigration Department of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan.
en: Don't be angry, boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they are trying to go to, but also that they have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: there are few Turkmen, Uzbek, and Tajik people who can afford to receive a normal primary education.
This is because their families don't even have anything to give the children to eat, let alone clothe them, put shoes on them, and buy them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if one does not know the language, for them to recognize it.
One feels humiliated and inferior.
However, when it comes to language law, defenders of rights point to an important point.
Exams will only be held for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be neither an exam nor, consequently, any official job.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
Welcome or no entry for strangers
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
en: Furthermore, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake registration can be done quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
Russian police officers know that we usually carry fake documents, are unregistered, and cases of extortion appear.
Umed Hushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, commented to journalists that they are asked for one hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea.
Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting.
On the first day of the language law coming into effect, it was made clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be falsified.
Several "fake" language proficiency certificates have already been seized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to make it easier to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, bringing together government officials and rights defenders.
So far, authorities can promise immigrant workers who have not been able to pass the test the first time more time to study the basic language course.
Additionally, jobs that do not require active communication with people will be offered to immigrants who do not speak Russian.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal trade of weapons.
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low.
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to enforce the law more strictly with regard to civilian gun owners.
The government's response to the recent incidents is: Crackdown on wedding celebrations which luckily had no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which seven people lost their lives.
The police want to ban the use and possession of firearms in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry firearms, from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea was supported by the head of the State Duma's security and anti-corruption committee, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on gun possession will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying a "hard-line policy".
An open letter has appeared online, whose authors, representatives of various shooting organizations, demand that such "senseless rigor" measures be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism involving firearms is minimal, Vasiliy Lésnikov, a criminal lawyer, told the BBC Russia news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during the six months of 2012, 142 crimes involving the use of registered firearms in the Interior were committed, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian firearms sector will not be an obstacle for the criminal to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow any weapon can be found at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market for weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the High Command.
en: Screenshot of the website accepting orders for weapons
The first, "vestige of the army or military", refers to the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
en: Baranets says that the weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves.
Black market firearms, stolen by criminals and law enforcement personnel.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those directly stolen by law enforcement officers.
Illegal weapons are being sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven accounts that some fires were deliberately set to cover up a shortage," comments a former soldier.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also do their part.
Now private arms factories have proliferated which are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the table to the black market, including Moscow's, says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
They have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the ex-military.
en: Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal weapons supply to the black market.
An report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
English: Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
Most illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from military and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "due to officials whose job is related to weapons," the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases are stolen during the production of weapons, and 5% corresponds to "illegal archaeology".
The attendant of one of the gun stores, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the guns found by illegal excavators are not bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
He says that more often, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a shipment.
Through a warrant officer, the supplier purchases one unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove her from the registry and pass her over the fence.
This person takes the weapon to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two magazines, they tell us.
But of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan needs to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers,” adds the clerk.
Like in a luxury boutique
The seller and buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy suggested that I go to the "Begovaya" platform, where a man would take me to a "corner" where we could negotiate.
I only found out the price of the weapon there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
The shop attendant says, "I need a friend with connections to get a gun. I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there one also has to arrive, let's say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked to be told that his daughter had lost a tooth".
Even I can get a pair of steel gloves through a trusted person.
He also supplies them to me alone because he knows I won't rat him out.
Newcomers seek weapons in various ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets tested himself in the role of illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
en: The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.

Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the US are going on strike.
Approximately one quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's.
In the United States, a wave of protests has been sparked in recent days against the low wages paid to workers at Walmart corporation supermarkets and popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one is willing to assert yet whether this wave will reach the nine points or if it will lose strength and subside in its early stages.
The protest actions have the support of the unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wage increases received by Walmart and fast food workers, the goal of the protest organizers is to create worker unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the labor movement.
Is forty-six cents per year?
en: Last week's shopping frenzy began on Thanksgiving Day, also known as "Black Friday". On that day, millions of Americans embarked on a shopping spree that sometimes ended in clashes.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed picket lines in protest alongside unions and left-wing activists at the corporation's stores, whose products are aimed at people with modest and moderate incomes.
en: Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuums, eggs and milk.
The products in your stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of the larger supermarkets.
This is why many of the underpaid workers at Walmart only shop at work.
Availability and selection of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because it pays its workers low wages.
These workers also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
On "Black Friday," the participants of the protest demanded a raise in wages and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation had gone from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who makes $9.50 an hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than what is spent on salaries now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost them just 46 cents more.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they are spending now.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that the protest only took place in nine states and caused no loss to the corporation.
en: Walmart's "Black Friday" extended in their stores from 8 PM on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold around 5000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers processed almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, the company representative, stated in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that less than five Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than "another PR stunt" organized by the workers' union.
Free box!
Protests continued this week in New York, targeting not the big box stores Walmart (which has no love in this progressive city, and thus far there are none), but rather McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
en: McDonald's claims to sell billions of servings, yet they won't even give you sick leave and won't pay you for your honest work!
en: Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to both federal and New York state law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing wages, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York make $8.90 per hour.
en: No one earns less than them in this city.
How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, it's incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble upon interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off of this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30am on Thursday at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that unions for workers be created in the fast food sector.
The US law prohibits the administration from denying this right and punishing union movement activists with tricks and dismissals.
English: On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
Excessive staff turnover is one of the main issues.
Discordant
Loud protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the action took place halfway through the rally at the McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular City Council Member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
en: The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said, "We must support fast-food workers in their fight for fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As described by the New York Times, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is still unclear if this will spark a massive movement.
For now, fooling the brain is not so easy.
Augmented reality, so popular among tech enthusiasts, has recently become commonplace primarily through the use of special glasses.
At the start of summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was revealed that Microsoft had also filed a patent application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Sharam Izadi, it was revealed that for the scientists at the company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
en: Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also strive to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity as a whole has been stuck in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with their finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the major changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
en: What else does the future hold for us?
Despite Kinect bringing interaction to a physical level, much of it still takes place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
We must free the world of computing from ours, the physical one, and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around them.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more convenient way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
en: What do you think about voice control?
Is a popular detail, but don't you think it's overrated?
en: Of course it cannot be considered a panacea, the issue of privacy remains unresolved, as we do not always want others to know our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not of loose movements, but rather shorter ones.
Additionally, the gestures were not captured by the device's camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
en: It is currently very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
en - How is that?
English: For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will speak and show at the same time.
en - I usually just speak.
Oh, that's going to be really hard to recognize.
Is it that you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to primarily work on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine a person's reactions.
These could be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
en: If we are talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with 3D recognition.
en: Of course, it would be great to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But the issue is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
English: So, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
en: Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
en: Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, created an adjustable processing delay contact sensor ranging from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth noting that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the latter value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
I would find it very useful for my work to have an equivalent of such a device that does not require contact in order to increase the frames per second.
Is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
English: The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually the infrared ray emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually just a simple visible spectrum sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, conversely, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the curvature of camera placement and see how this would help to determine three-dimensional position.
En: From what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Doesn't it seem that, from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
en: Of course, holding up a smartphone all the time is not very comfortable, but I think the best option would be a transmutable augmented reality where, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone.
Glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any ordinary mortal.
There is one problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
I often say in my lectures that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Register the perfect touch!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at providing tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasound beams directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to what one feels if someone were blowing on the fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wristbands that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel when he sees something?
That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge we will have to grapple with for a long time: how to make a person physically located in a very confined space feel like they are in an open, almost limitless space. We are also working on the idea of treadmill-like platforms, as well as giant balloons.
Tricking the brain is not so easy right now, it will take many years of work.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, as many things are found in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective preference instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
en: "Rosbalt" continues the "St. Petersburg Vanguard" project, dedicated to citizens who are at the forefront of art and culture.
This list of the best features brilliant figures from the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: often they find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
Everyone in the city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed head to toe in red, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion and opening events.
Kirill Miller's paintings always draw crowds wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from Saint Petersburg, creating new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
He is also an urban man, whose presence on the streets of the city brings smiles to the inhabitants and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took up an organ grinder and became the organ grinder of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to take on such a difficult role, owing to his bohemian existence, his philosophy, and his image.
En: Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I focus on appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, image makers, and society.
Although in society, anything that isn't a bit grey can provoke aggression and stir up bad properties.
But my provocations are meant to start a conversation.
All the story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
en: When did you realize you had to be an artist?
In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my works were displayed.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old, unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, those who followed those exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I immersed myself in the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
All of this came together at your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were supposed to come together.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, before any reforms, existed an artistic music club, a bohemian club, the house of bohemia of Saint Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "La oreja de Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends were singing light songs under the phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many shows before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave it to Trachtenberg and it was the start of his great career; he received his basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137" and "Club Griboyedov" are the remnants of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers were going there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was conducted in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
I was chosen for the "Artist of the Year" nomination, and that marked the culmination of my career.
In these new times, it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty, and the culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go separate ways. One can be popular but very uncultured.
There is something recognizable in your work.
Many of my paintings are hits, in them the current and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I am going to do a scheduled presentation, "The Russian Museum of Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being that way is painful and terrifying.
But in clowns everything is smeared and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothing.
Now people are judged by their clothes, focusing on the external rather than the internal person.
Maybe that person should not be given a handshake, but spat in the face.
The deception will be eliminated when the clothes are changed.
We recently saw you in the role of an urban organ grinder. A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be it!
en: But, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, and tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
People used to gather in packs, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simple ones something else.
Now everyone has split into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to impress.
Now, every cult hero has their 100 fans.
Thousands come to listen to Stas Mikhailov!
They will see it, the abandoned ones, there the sex-social sphere works.
There is a cultural event with 300 people attending, but 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management and less money, everything wilts away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin what you have achieved.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
En: Kirill, ¿qué le hace falta a San Petersburgo?
Good culture experts.
English: There is a concept called "Cultural Officer".
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were right, everything was different; the kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts in place.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could very well be experts, but they are closed off, because higher level experts are needed to properly assess them and open up their path.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
En: Erarta es lo mismo, pero con la diferencia de que admiten abiertamente que no toda la obra moderna es aceptada, por lo que algunos artistas tienen que buscar otros museos.
en: What does St. Petersburg mean to you?
Es: San Petersburgo no es una capital cultural. Moscú tiene mucha más cultura y ofrece un terreno más fértil.
But it is hard for art to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural landscape and now we have more writers than readers, this is not good.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is minuscule.
We need to make art fashionable again, like it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be carried out with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or killer asteroid impact.
Space caravans with humans onboard set off in search of a replacement planet.
en: The main question to preserve humanity is: How to continue the species in a state of weightlessness or on the same replacement planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
en: "These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, the surface temperature on Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The issues of reproduction in space were first addressed with flora.
It has been half a century since experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
After that came insect breeding in orbit, small fruit flies, Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how embryos develop in a weightless environment.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the problems start.
en: Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, explains that "the problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to keep on its own feet and start to move".
Without finding support, the chicks were flipping randomly.
After 10 hours with the newborns, a total atrophy of the instincts occurred.
The chicks did not react to the light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"We managed to hatch the chicks twice, but then we gave up because it was impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychev comments on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a "mini-ark" of biological specimens flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the Bion biosatellite only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
Nothing supernatural was found at first.
English: "This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," comments Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the issue of reproduction has yet to be addressed directly in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, when losing their usual habitat, simply cannot fulfill their mating instinct.
The man, however, unlike small animals, can in principle.
Humans have abstract reasoning and are capable of creating an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for over 50 years.
Tereshkova faced the greatest risk.
The most precious thing humanity has is the female body.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
Can she have a baby after this flight?
After all, no one has answered this question," comments aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only a year after her spaceflight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice went into orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts who have had successful long flights are few, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more can be said, it is even dangerous in orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek out some new pathways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and creating artificial gravity.
The Hydro-Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Training Center is a mandatory stage in preparation for flight.
In zero-gravity conditions, astronauts practice their space work skills.
Water simulates weightlessness.
For an adult, water is a comfortable, yet still hostile environment, but for a newborn baby, it is their native element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on land originated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is in the amniotic fluid inside its mother for approximately 9 months, as it will be easier for them to adjust to water afterwards.
In principle, this makes sense, because from the moment of birth until the first bath only two weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming instructor.
In summary, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravity, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In zero gravity, abdominal and pelvic muscles deteriorate quickly, reducing the ability to expel the fetus.
Well, we'll skip that, relying on stimulating action for labor.
It is possible, of course, to give birth in a special chamber, it will push you through.
English: "And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
en: Furthermore, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is impossible to dress a newborn in an astronaut training suit, as with adults, in orbit.
Just deprive him of what is vital to him.
en: "And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unsuitable person," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
En: However, in time this will be a reality, when humans in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
NKÚ Chief: The inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the responsible politician.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is lagging.
Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office (NKÚ), stated this in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
en: "The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we are lacking," thus describing the current situation.
Czech and German inspectors' joint inspections also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, mention Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
en: Kala notes that the law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor demand obligations.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech team and the German team, within which the legislation concerning public tenders in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
We have been carrying out this parallel control for about two years now.
In simplified terms: European legislation regulates how public tenders should be organized, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is thus confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but it is necessary to focus on the enforcement of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
Exactly this kind of common control could contribute to us stopping investing efforts in the concretion of laws, reduction and improvement of limits, even though this might not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting something suitable at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest price) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But just because we reduce the limit of allocations does not mean we will achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You are speaking about the issues of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public tenders.
en: How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, such as the NKÚ, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Audit) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only difference is that in their case it is structured somewhat differently, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
en: Competencies are also to some extent analogous, however, since Germany has a federal organization, the audit courts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only audit federal money, which we here call state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, in Germany, are monitored by the Federal Court of Audit.
Is local legislation simpler than ours?
Generally, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data. Nevertheless, Germany remains a model in some aspects, but it cannot be precisely stated in what it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
No, definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries we take as models must face a great number of problems.
If it weren't so, it wouldn't be of any benefit to them to collaborate with our office, don't you think?
What did the amendment to the law on public tenders mean for your Office? Is there any way in which its impact can be seen?
Taking into account that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we conduct ex post checks, there is a certain delay required.
We are currently observing in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are corrected and similar.
Do you think the passing of this law is beneficial or does it create more of a bureaucratic mess?
I believe this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The issue that may arise is that the regulations "tighten" and become impossible to comply with.
Under the previous regulations, the persons in charge were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programs of the regional council), and any law not respected in the field of public tenders meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to toughen the law in this way?
No, I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal mistake, which has no impact on decision-making.
This type of system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
en: How do we get out of this?
We will see where this journey we have started will take us.
The Prime Minister recently declared that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, in reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system prohibited or allowed?
Law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and enforce obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we'll act like nothing happened.
In public procurement law, the regulations are quite strict in terms of how one must act formally. And that is how it should be in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we are lacking.
The roads have patches of ice, but for the most part they are passable.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are covered with ice and snow.
Although most roads are passable, caution must be taken on some of them.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but had patches of ice and snow.
The temperature is dropping and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. The thermometers will rise slightly during the day.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the layer of snow is thin.
In contrast, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters on the peaks of the Metal Mountains.
In some places visibility was still poor due to the fog, according to the information from the regional highways operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the first-category highway in the region are now open without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
Likewise, all second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
Nevertheless, in some of them there are still stretches with remains of ice and packed snow.
It is necessary to increase attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
The Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
In some roads of Eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, according to the Roads and Highways Directorate in its pages.
Road workers are warning drivers about the danger of ice patches forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
en: Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav, and Vysokého Mýta, and especially on secondary and tertiary roads.
The highways I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the roads of the Krkonoše and Orlické hory mountains.
There is a layer of packed snow on the higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the Eastern Bohemia area, the sky will be between clear and partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
The temperatures will generally range between three below zero and one degree positive, a weak wind will blow.
The Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, although extreme caution should be exercised and one must adapt to the weather.
In the early morning hours there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what is inferred from the information from the regional highway operations control center.
The D5 highway is almost unrestrictedly passable, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the stretch between kilometer 80 and 131.
Most major highways have a dry, ice-free surface.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov border road with Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The secondary and third-category roads are wet, so in this case, patches of ice are also warned of.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less-traveled roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially melted snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the Červenohorské port and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road workers cleared the snow during the night; three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper highway, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are still remnants of snow.
Drivers at the Červenohorské port will encounter partly melted snow heading towards Jeseník, confirmed an employee of the Šumper Road Administration to ČTK today.
On the ground and at night, their colleagues also came to Jesenická, and after the chemical treatment, the trails in the higher areas are now cleared and wet.
On the Olomouc road the lanes are passable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the lanes remain wet.
The Ústí nad Labem Region and the Liberec Region
Road operators in Northern Bohemia have reported complications on various stretches early this morning.
Except for a few places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. In the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech mountain range, however, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No service complications have been reported at this time.
Road operators have warned of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. Rain and melting snow are expected during the day, and the sky will be clear and icy at night.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced on I/13 highway at the border between Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region from the main roads.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be closed due to the branches of the trees that had bent over the road under the weight of the snow.
Simon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at our concerts.
It is said that the end of the world is coming in less than a month, what do you think about it?
It's just one of many other alarmist news stories that we like to cling to.
We in The Tap Tap music group like to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
Additionally, in December you are organizing a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-sponsored charitable act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar ending on December 21st at 11:10am.
Yesterday, on December 20th at 9 PM, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all forged the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state we will leave the world to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, titled "End of the World, Canceled".
Is it currently popular on YouTube, can it be heard at benefit concerts?
Yes, of course, and it will be the last one, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All performers will sing it together at the three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomas Hanak wrote the lyrics for this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, in addition to organizing many charity events and concerts...
We are putting all our effort into participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised from the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
We completed the equipment for the barrier-free Studeo educational center for the sixth consecutive year in partnership with the Tap civil association at Jedličkův ústav.
The students of Jedličkův ústav school regularly receive visits from teachers with whom they do fun and interesting activities.
en: Students do not have enough financial resources to pay the teachers and we are making an effort to make it possible.
In the context of the completion of the works at Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, multiple groups and performers perform.
en: What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
In Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
For more detailed information, you can check out www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned for the future?
In May, we will be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival, so we will surely be preparing an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and, personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are anything but minimalistic, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London, and Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
en: There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
en: Nevertheless, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which still amazes me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Going abroad allows you to compare different societies' attitudes towards people with disabilities and other aspects.
en: What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, and it is still not common for someone to travel alone in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Something as common as giving priority to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator is not common there.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to bring attention to the issues of people with disabilities.
What aspects should we take example from more advanced countries?
We are behind in many aspects...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and betterment of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid, it is very common for people with a severe disability to travel independently in public and be able to go to the service, the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we are a bit ahead!
A respectful and barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers to emerge, everything will truly begin to change.
So far, there are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
English: The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered Jedličkův ústav as an educator, where I had many young people around me who wanted to do something.
Since I am a musician, I play the saxophone among other instruments, and I founded an amateur band with a colleague.
With time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič said, it got a bit out of hand (laughter).
However, popularity didn't come until these last few years, am I wrong?
It is true that we were greatly helped by connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the aid from the European Union, we are able to afford quality teaching staff, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that was there, that something can be done differently.
The entertainment world is full of things that look alike.
It makes sense, in its own way, that all new things are met with caution and take a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
Someone's first impression of us is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings suffering from which we should have compassion.
People are capable of living a full and developed life, provided, of course, they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out well for people with disabilities, then it is not only a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds, and when they find out they have to attend rehearsals for two days, go to the audition, and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, their initial euphoria quickly fades away.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap group has twenty members.
How many of them were already there at the start of 1998?
en: Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, it can't be helped.
en: Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the long-awaited end of the world, Thursday, December 20th, 2012 at 9 PM.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, at Fléda in Brno, and at Plynojem in Ostrava, and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via video conference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled".
The goal of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to fund the multi-functional equipment of the barrier-free STUDEO educational center at Jedličkův ústav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry with the pre-sale option at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second ESA member from the former Eastern Bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
en: Poland began an intense collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaging in space flights before World War II, though their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6th, 1933, where he presented his pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one to show interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), previously mentioned, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
en: Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known worldwide and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925, a dresina was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are also unknown.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresina or for its braking.
The information about this dresser is limited to what was reported in the press at the time.
Starting in 1933, Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is evident that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
Nevertheless, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, the prototype of a photoelectric hunter missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of engines for missiles.
Before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all the works.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
After the war, other studies related to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy, reference is made for the first time to astronautics with four very extensive articles dedicated to it.
In one of them, by Professor M. Subotowicze, the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics was proposed.
At that time, projects for artificial satellites had already been launched and it was obvious that space research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to become a member of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and in the fall of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was conducted.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10th, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not exceed 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rocket air tests began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters tall and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development was to be the subject of actual scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission was to monitor high-altitude winds.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built between 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other in terms of the available space for scientific equipment.
The available space for volume in the Meteor-1A rocket was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters, and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The peak height for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, with its first air tests beginning in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in altitude.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Suspending the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the Social Work Law.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing issues from a broader perspective.
In the EU, liberal economic systems, like in the globalized world, are based on the principle of increased economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the beginning of free trade and the unrestricted and free movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large disparities in labor costs (wages) creates economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "causes a decrease" in the price of the competitor with the aim of taking the largest part of the market and, in this way, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most business owners, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Due to the lack of social responsibility of private capital and, therefore, its lack of responsibility for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the state's social spending necessarily increases.
All of this situation fosters complete disinterest from business owners to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profits.
The situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies where governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially lowering the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population regardless of social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes to existing laws.
The goal is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
en: This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted rights of employees in terms of labor rights.
The result is an increasing poverty alongside the widening gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food distribution points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves through their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid has now reached one million.
In the context of increasing competitiveness of the German economy, a rather frequent case occurs: people employed with such a low salary that the state has to pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
An scandal of this kind related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
Practically all states in the Southern EU are leading, without a doubt, to the same situation due to their cost-saving measures. People, pressured by a drastic decline in their social standing, are forced to emigrate like in the 19th century or to barely survive on a terrible salary on the fringes of society, in the hope that one day private capital investors will come to the country.
en: Do we need to ask ourselves where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty either passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African people still work for a tiny fraction of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
English: Liberal theories and media outlets assert time and again that the state should not provide capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital fiercely defends the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask oneself if private capital does not influence political progress with its selfishness and, therefore, the entire state.
Yes, in this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The evidence is the existence of powerful and omnipresent lobbies in all states in practice.
The outcome is a desperate situation manifested in the realm of corruption, in mutual favors, and in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: the state ministries, lacking financial resources, commission the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is then approved in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not come from the people, as proclaimed in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one described by Appian in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and administrations were being forced upon it".
In exchange for bribes, illicitly obtained favors, and assistance in financing stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unchecked and people went to the polls with their votes already prearranged... "there was no one of character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, due to this disorganization, the state was without consuls for eight months"... "It began to be seriously discussed that the only remedy for such a grave situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought of Pompey, Caesar rose to power and forever transformed democracy into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that modern society is based on selfish preferences that disregard common interests.
Private capital is not, in essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The outcome is the same as it was then, an unprecedented decline of the elite with no effort made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must be sought, therefore, in the unrestrained liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In light of the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favor of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, awaiting the next blow.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
The suspension of the law on public tenders is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
en: This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution lies in concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the state's capital participation and citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to the benefit of the state.
En Israel: el laboratorio del caos.
English: "Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile, whose chorus goes "Let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, diverse reactions.
One side, from Israel, argues in favor of the right to self-defense and casts Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other side supports Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs, and labels Israel a terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on who is to blame for the periodic massacres and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of the violence.
My intention is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, a look to uncover who benefits from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached based on my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driving force behind the events of modern history.
Throughout human history, the history of struggles for power has been at the forefront.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters always directed their steps autonomously or if there was someone behind their throne guiding their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power it implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families, one stands out as the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I wouldn't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Naturally.
In the 1890s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that their name would no longer be associated with serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, provided them with protection, which always meant a strengthening for them.
They have significant stakes in almost all central banks around the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi only four remained, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the charter of the Rothschild's Bank of America central bank, began printing money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 at the theater.
en: JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve (FED) system and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their ambition for world power led them between 1859 - 1871 to devise a plan for three world wars, designed by the Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war aimed to eliminate the large monarchical states across Europe; the second sought to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (such a number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a pre-project for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method of operation employed by the group of the wealthiest families, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamic of triggering crises and then offering a solution (order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like the one in 1907 would not happen again.
So, after the successful assassination of the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after, as a result of it, World War I was unleashed, Tsarist Russia was shattered with the start of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly and unjustifiably from a military and economic standpoint, with Germany's surrender (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great Central European power, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To lay the groundwork for the Second World War, bankers and politicians were allowed to covertly create a conflictive situation due to the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Afterwards, it was enough to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to culprits, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to and did so well represent the role of the fifth column, igniting the flame and causing the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds drove the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aimed for the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned previously laid the groundwork for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the Arab population of the area began.
Terrorist attacks were occurring on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know if Hitler pulled too hard on the string to which he was initially tied by international bankers or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
es:  Israel fue oficialmente fundado en 1948 y, de la misma manera en que las reparaciones de guerra impuestas a Alemania abrieron el camino hacia la Segunda Guerra Mundial, con la proclamación del estado de Israel se creó el foco para una tercera guerra.
If international bankers were to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become the first line of victims in battle, now alongside the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within its own country but also on an international scale. Take for example how supporters and detractors of Israel are sharply divided.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice breed injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of some individuals and their quest for world power?
In this regard, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their rulers, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only put forward their own candidates in elections.
El presidente de Israel B. Netanyahu es un político fascista leal a los banqueros internacionales, que busca desesperadamente declarar la guerra a Irán. Si se llegara a producir un conflicto, podría convertirse en una amenaza global, ya que Irán es miembro de la Organización de Cooperación de Shanghai (China, India, Rusia, Pakistán...). Además, Irán controla el estrecho de Ormuz, por donde pasa el 20% de todo el petróleo mundial (el corredor de navegación tiene sólo dos millas de ancho). Esto podría llevar a la destrucción de la economía mundial.
How are the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 now seen in light of current events: "All we need is a good crisis and the people will agree to a new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world where every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
En: He forces everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell unless they bear the name of this beast or the number of its name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers of forehead, add up the numbers of this monster.
en: The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.
en: If it gets tough, call Hollywood - Argo Movie
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive outlook: they could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as doing so would put the trust of their allies in other countries at risk.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was beyond their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was further intensified by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the US, their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and animosity towards Iran.
The failure in Iran decisively contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The movie "Argo" directed and acted by Ben Affleck dramatizes an episode of this story, which yielded a small success for America.
Six employees of the building escaped just before it was occupied by the embassy.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which it helped a covert story with a twist: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew that was scouting the location in the country for the shooting of a sci-fi blockbuster.
Gender blending
The plan devised by the "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem true, articles were written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the movie has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
The Affleck movie is a unique blend of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of a successful caper (an example could be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the movie, moods are blended together. On one hand, we find well-documented sequences from Tehran. In the credits sequence, iconic photographs of the period of the events are shown, which were captured in the same way in the movie; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes that are a bit lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: suited men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the office hallways, over the phone...
en: Ben Affleck has managed to reboot his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of ridicule, has become a respected director and his manner of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little One" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck movie where the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Likewise, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old movies above Hollywood standards.
Ben Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is "filmed" in Canada.
The best scenes in the movie take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy takeover is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
En las escenas ficticias, Affleck y sus colaboradores logran un efecto similar al del equipo impostor en el bazar de Teherán.
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story told does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
He manages quite well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here not everything is so elegantly presented (the scene where the crisis lurks in the Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the frenzied search for its trace become a madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more screen time and are by no means the only ones in this movie.
For these reasons, Affleck's movie loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, appreciate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But for it to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas, and circus tents
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd rules or ideas from the EU workshop".
We came up with the idea after the last event, the EU is planning to approve a quota of 40 percent of women in management positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
en: Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have had better prices on life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
en: People can propose other amazing ideas from the EU workshop until the end of this year.
The election will take place at the end of February 2013, reported Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of traditional mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
Criticism has been leveled at the de facto ban on using the term "spreadable butter" or the removal of the classic light bulb from stores.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters in length.
The EU apparatus often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas in the EU must have a minimum length of 14 centimeters and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it is only seeking to harmonize the non-homogeneous national standards which have been in place until now, making their commercialization more complicated.
The regulations regarding fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been relaxed based on the fact that the existing directive leads to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll could be the EU prescription from last year according to which it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years old are not allowed to inflate inflatable balloons without adult supervision.
The EU was referring here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
en: There is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years old.
Curious occurrences arise even in our country
en: The regulation regarding European officials is equally absurd: anyone who has an official role in the EU is not allowed to use the name Macedonia. To avoid offending Greece, one must refer to FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food stocks on the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Afterward, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying countries without access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies.
These kinds of ideas did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
We are at a disadvantage due to the fact that we do not have a sea.
In Autumn 2004, then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) declared, "We are requesting compensation from the European Union."
He argued it with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and it had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from maritime ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
en: Rare prescriptions are an exception.
Member state guidelines are often the subject of criticism, yet the EU's efforts in terms of regulations and more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
Experts say the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have secured in budget negotiations.
Czechs too have a soft spot, just like other countries in the Union, for the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always been victorious in these battles.
After six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the origin denomination of Olomouc curd cheese, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from the distillation of sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of Protected Designations of Origin of the EU, along with the well-known feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the marzipan from the German city of Lübeck and the Parma ham, the Karlovy Vary biscuits, the carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, and even the Žatec hop variety are already included.
As protected Geographical Indications of the EU, you can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší wafers.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, what made you decide to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything were well in our country, then I would not present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how stealing has been rampant in our country for the last twenty years, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are increased, and the retirement age is raised.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
Since I am already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly afterwards it set off towards the presidency.
Are you not turning your back on those people who have voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the senate elections.
If I was elected senator, I later clarified that I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
Therefore, I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that criticizes in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
Media outlets are also to blame, as they discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He enters the presidential race with financial theses and criminal liabilities of politicians and the declaration of property worth over twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to have the profession of guide recognized as self-employment, and we succeeded.
The problem lies in the politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech perspective, I get the impression that people view me as more left-wing.
For me, it doesn't matter whether it's a bit left or a bit right.
What matters to me is that we make it through.
I don't care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
They joke when they say you are populist.
Is he not demonstrating it with what he says?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
You try to get close to them.
Some may call it populism, but all of the proposals I'm talking about already work in the world or are discussed by well-known experts.
But without the support of Parliament, only slogans remain.
With this, he cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Do you think that if you address people and speak to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists, and civil society and try to get them on my side to achieve it.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and state prosecutors.
Eventually, they would have to communicate why they do not want it.
If there is a strong character that points out disputes, pressure can be exerted in the political scene.
Let's take the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure, as an example.
At the same time, I claim that I am only an enthusiast, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and ideals.
I have just started in politics and am trying to get as much support as possible for my platform.
I'm trying to make it on my own, but if it doesn't work out, I'll be leaving in six years and going back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can't do anything alone, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities to see if they might be interested in running for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I started out on the premise that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scales.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, there are two of us from the independent sector.
People chose the senate, so it will be difficult to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have the time to check the impeccable past of each potential party member, nor do I have the money.
I don't have money for the presidential campaign, there are only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
en: Don't you have any money?
en: Talk about property statements, what is yours like?
I estimate my private property at around 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land valued at 25 million, an apartment valued at ten million, another apartment appraised at eight million, an art collection worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million, a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the bank account I have a couple of million.
I have an Aston Martin by the way because it was my childhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
Does he drive an Aston Martin, his property is valued at 60 million and he has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money of your own in.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that there is not much interest in my program.
I do not have the obligation to pay for the campaign with my own money.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive in terms of senator's salary.
But I couldn't live off of it. For example, I couldn't pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I would not put myself forward as a candidate.
Will he continue with his business activity in order to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As promised, I have partially left my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will be my substitute in the spring.
People would want to be the Good Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to make a living.
en: How much do you usually make monthly as an entrepreneur?
en: Between 200,000 and 400,000, I keep winning.
If I were president, then I would leave the business.

MVRDV Architecture Studio proves that true adventures are not just in the head - exemplified by the Spijkenisse Library and the recently completed "Mountain of Books" - 2 photos.
en: Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the street, says, "I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and finally there's something interesting to see."
Stefan Spermon, a IT technician at a large company located near the library, notes: "Furthermore, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library nowadays.
We all have Internet, tablets, and e-books.
Nobody goes to those outdated libraries by choice, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom town located on the outskirts of Rotterdam that barely deserves a passing visit, holds the dubious honor of having achieved a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges represented on euro banknotes in the form of concrete miniaturas decorated with reinforced steel.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
So that is how the political leaders decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: they had to build a library!
Dutch architect Winy Maas of MVRDV, a master of the art of bar charts and responsible for fun yet cynical buildings, took the topic with his usual serenity and attended the competition presentation in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
As the jury looked around perplexed and shrugged their shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'.
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros stands in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office, and a couple of residential and terraced buildings.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
Additionally, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking in history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather guess a dairy farm, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But most of all, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese dome.
It is true that there is an elevator that takes us right to the center of this mountainous mass, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather they prefer to merge with its topography with each step of their climb to the summit.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to take in with the eye, the brick-fired floor and the elegant street lamps unmistakably support the public nature of the library.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
When looking up, you can see the benches of the park, the dogs, and the children playing soccer.
Everywhere books, books, and more books.
en: Winy Maas states that usually book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center an enormous dark room is opened, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal.
We have turned the classic spatial configuration upside down and taken the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is well utilized: in the middle are the offices, the internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center, and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch, and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
We wanted to work with recycled materials, explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
So this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from farming.
For many years, plastic fabric of few millimeters thick has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to achieve plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this almost 500-meter continuous route around the mountain awaits the reward: from the cafeteria not only is there a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy delicious Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the appropriate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
Despite its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology, according to Trouborst.
The heating and cooling needed are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the mountain of books being situated beneath a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden arches placed across the glass facade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is up to the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to step foot in the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
English: Similarly, Traditional Chinese Medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She rates the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
This is intended to fill, for now, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has struck a chord.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
I believe that thanks to our initiative, now all the inhabitants have some kind of connection with this building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the library.
Although it is only there to adorn.
en: In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved great success in the discipline of creating an identity, which is known in specialized jargon.
Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
Regardless of how young and inexperienced they may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
en: Szabo: "Germans must take on a more leading role"
Germany abstained from voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather awkward diplomatic position.
German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported earlier this week that Germany indicated it would vote against the proposal to grant Palestinian territories the status of observer state at the United Nations.
However, Berlin eventually abstained.
Why?
en: Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Does it prove difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is due to the fact that Germany is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
What makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to take on a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still feeling out what their role will be, but they have already started down the path towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries like France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean specifically from a German perspective?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European allies.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, namely in exports and its relationships with certain regions such as Russia, China, and the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf, on the one hand.
For this reason, she must be careful not to alienate herself from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it so much importance since it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys a great degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that a break as drastic as in the case of Libya has occurred.
Perhaps Germany has earned some respect with this.
In the end, all of this has only served to demonstrate that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
In contrast, the US has clearly come out in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Always these disparities have existed due to the United States' domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding towards the European position.
But due to the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that stance.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not actually have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is pursuing.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relationships with Israel and the United States on the one hand with the stance of its main EU partners on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for Germans.
Of course it would be a bit easier for Germans if there was a coherent and homogenous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but must drive things from their own position.
They are doing exactly that with the euro right now.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leadership role in forcing Europe to take a European stance.
en: Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I believe the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany actually wish to take on a leading role?
Is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet gotten used to it, it always remains somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that whenever Germany takes the lead, certain anti-German feelings are stirred up.
This is not easy for Germans.
It is an old problem and that is no one wants to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
English: US influence in European politics is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not yet filling that gap, who is left then?
Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them, or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, c'est la vie!

Protection of Brands in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese Brands
En: Armani is a globally known brand and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
en: What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name lies an officially registered denomination in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, this enjoys protection while the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
Even then it is not clear that they will be given the right.
English: "It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer from the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in intellectual property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my desk.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters in order to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies also legally copy each other in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opened a filing cabinet in which he kept records of the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also made use of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that Chinese people are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights.
In big cities there are large multi-story stores dedicated solely to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he is fighting against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to benefit from a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
en: It is referred to as "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand in Chinese.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan".
Refers to women who have "caught" a wealthy man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
en: "It is detrimental to the business, we have to fight against it," demands Pattloch.
The brand is faltering, its monopolistic position is disappearing, and the damage to its image is immense.
Financial losses and legal costs of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of luxury iconic products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is the third largest luxury goods market and the one growing at the fastest rate.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registry is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch discusses cases where the court dismissed a claim because so much time had passed that the name subject to the claim had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, they may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged their brand in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company which has recently been acquired by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, today Chinese people can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that strongly resembled BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction of the original.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The Beijing CTMO Trademark Office acknowledges that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the emergency labor situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain unresolved.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money.
As is usually the case in China, the figures are astonishing.
Last year, the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the Trademark Office.
It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in royalties.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
The Germans have managed to stop the illegal production of imitation car parts.
The imitator has secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"We have brought this situation upon ourselves because in Germany surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office also dismissed the appeal of the Munich residents.
In the two subsequent instances, Freudenberg has been vindicated, but the opposing side is still fighting the case to this day.
English: Take extreme caution.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident he can resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review records up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other party a "six-figure sum in euros" in order to reach an amicable agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
en: "This shows how much we care," Wentzler states.
The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe.
Specifically, if the imitators secure rights over unregistered trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg in Germany for shoes and leather products.
The group has been away from this commercial area for a while, but they managed to prevent registration.
en: "We must be very careful," Wentzler states.
He and lawyer Pattloch both recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark legislation, but what needs to be done is "also register in China anything that may be eligible for protection," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the matter can end up costing much more than a simple registration.
If Freudenberg were to lose the last round of its own battle, then it would have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for its own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would get us kicked out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir rehearses and in Swaziland, the orphans of AIDS are rejoicing.
The story of a bond capable of overcoming more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, high heels and loafers search for the beat on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
en Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to rise slowly, swirling, getting tangled and following each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to lose his temper as he tries to bring order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers, ranging in age from 23 to 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
en: 23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
Over 40% of the population is already seropositive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 to 20 euros a month, you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school fees, uniforms, and guarantee a hot meal per day at the Gogo Center.
En zulú, imbongi significa "narrador de historias" o "panegirista".
Nobody in this room knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For the past ten years, this choir has been rehearsing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes transports them back to their place of origin: the south of Africa.
Esitjeni, a 8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg in northeastern Suaziland, is a village that relies on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large portion of them being children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Swaziland is affected by a high rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF, as exemplified by Esitjeni.
The population does not look favorably upon circumcision, a practice which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
Over 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the HIV virus, and dying before the age of thirty has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the most important thing: food, clothing and education.
Without a school title, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first, it was only the commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
However, one year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
en: What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, Human Papillomavirus, Genital Herpes, or Hepatitis.
English: Lice and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomoniasis, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
Heterosexual adults in the country have relatively low HIV infection rates; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
It is one tenth less than the previous year.
en: What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often they do not cause pain or produce other symptoms, so they are not detected.
How can one protect themselves?
En: Condoms can reduce the risk of transmission, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through uncleanliness and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend undergoing regular medical checkups, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late-term consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations, and last but not least, the fees the choir charges for its performances throughout Germany, they manage to raise quite a bit of money.
"We have already sent a total of 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," proudly states Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
She takes care of making sure orphans find a good home, for example with one of the grandmothers.
Zulu-speaking women elders, known as "gogos", are the pillars of the community.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, they provide a roof over their heads and make sure the children attend school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
en: Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
Additionally, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the village's inhabitants tested for HIV.
This is not something obvious, since, despite how widespread this disease is across the country, it is not usually openly discussed.
A king with 14 wives
Annette Lennartz states that AIDS is an absolute taboo because it has to do with sexuality.
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the rapid spread that HIV virus has experienced in the last decades.
But it is also due to the countless itinerant workers who travel across the country and take it with them wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "condoms are available for free on every corner, but they are hardly ever used.
en: It is another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years throughout Southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember from the era of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language; not only does this bring an excellent atmosphere and much joy, but it has also managed to bring a few tears to some angry border soldiers.
They always take the journey to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Despite this small population barely appearing on maps, the valley of the Ezulweni River is well known.
English: "Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," say the people of the place.
After traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the beat, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
en: The NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
Probably the ice layer has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science" show.
The Messenger probe has reportedly found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the area of the planet that is perpetually in shadow.
It looks like this one has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters of thickness.
Water presumably comes from comets or, more likely, asteroids that collided with Mercury in the past.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger probe chief investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are devoted to exploring the depths of the universe.

In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming region is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continuously forming; 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers hypothesize that it formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly composed of hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been growing steadily and the images they provide are becoming increasingly detailed.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
The mirror in the picture had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
This allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its immense capacity to gather light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, its capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo Radio Telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signals of extraterrestrial life.

The primary mirror will span 42 meters and consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
en: It is not expected to be able to take pictures until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
It is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions on Mauna Kea with a thirty-meter mirror diameter.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the start of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been identified.
In the image, the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope can be seen.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the Big Bang.
Researchers assume that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no conclusive evidence, since the Messenger probe orbits around the planet in a much closer orbit to the North Pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have certainty that it is so.

A search for footprints in a country where people aged 97 are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus rumbles down the winding road past wooded hills, rushing rivers, and the simple homes of the local farmers.
All is green and juicy, one might even think they are in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost region of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "Talyshi", a people of whom little is known, apart from their mastery of Persian and Azerbaijani and their long life spans.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts of an architecture perhaps too solid designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit in with such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly come to this place, as the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too strenuous.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers between the two cities because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys due to the Caspian Sea oil has yet to reach this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
Baku became famous in May due to the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the Elderly People of the World, says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen Talyshis from the area who have lived beyond 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
One of their sons died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived for 168 years.
Despite this, there is no birth certificate to certify it.
Taking into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, Müslümov's age seems quite suspicious.
Fatulayeva explains that he was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Has Sirali Muslumov been wrong about his age by a couple of decades then?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
In some regions of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, there are also people of very advanced age, according to Scholz. Even in Sardinia, there are many elderly men.
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age; especially when there is no civil registry.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is about the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in nutrition.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that the high-calorie diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Could it be the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what is customary in these parts.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor, tirelessly churning an enormous tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including Mirzayeva's son and daughter, both of whom have been grandparents for a long time.
Two small children are also jumping from side to side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that is served in typical curved-shaped glasses.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under her scarf she hides two long braids of dark blonde hair which her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
Mirzayeva stated, "I have never used shampoo either."
The pension is enough to live on.
He has always only eaten what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and peas.
I have never gone grocery shopping at a supermarket in my life.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst time was the period after World War II.
However, everything returned to normal when the "beloved father", Heydar Aliyev, took control of the situation.
This type of advertising sounds strange coming from an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the cult of the nation's father figure, who rules the country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He stayed in power until 2003, when he passed the torch to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which one can live well taking into account the situation here.
Maybe Mirzayeva's gray-haired son is right: "In our culture, the elderly are very respected."
They live in a big family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this isn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The phrase "Human Rights" is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations competing with each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division the country is facing.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare on sentimentality.
We must overcome the transition.
"It is my responsibility for that to happen, to the people and to God," he declared on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, particularly to Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
All of them, sunk without remedy until now in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologetically, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the world at large know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour overnight session, are truly concerning.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
en: But what does "principles" mean?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it appears that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway that comes with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This is at least what is suggested by a new article added: in all matters related to Sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to be this way, but this could mean that the clergy would control legislation, something which - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft of the constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
Under Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exercise a harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prisons.
As stipulated in the draft, the State shall protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values".
It is such an imprecise legal formulation that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinema and literature.
Speaking plainly, it is nothing but censorship.
No article explicitly states equality between men and women.
