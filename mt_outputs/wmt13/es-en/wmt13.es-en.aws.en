A Republican Strategy to Hinder Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from a lightning strike.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the vote, and strip citizens with criminal records of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law.
For this reason, the Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to keep in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo identification document issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity document.
Thus, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs that usually vote for the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, in 2011, Republican legislators supported certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of the ballot in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 led to a fall in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favored reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: To Get Tested or Not to Get Tested?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
This is more than enough reason to make men, who are already reticent in themselves, doubt whether or not they should be screened.
To take the test or not?
We have asked two specialists for advice.
Studies conducted in the United States detected a high rate of infections among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up after 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of suffering from metastases if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test starting at age 50, or starting at age 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that are not life-threatening in the long term, in which case you should opt instead for active surveillance of the disease.
Nowadays, many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, since the cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest that they actively monitor the disease and, if it progresses, we offer them treatment.
More and more frequently, we are determining precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test in any case.
But it's important to talk to your doctor to determine if you should get tested or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows evaluating the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite research progress, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is still the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we evaluated that around 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,” they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large numbers, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being, their research is inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another, what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each individual's concerns and family history with their doctor.
“Screening doesn't cause cancer.”
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a shock last summer, and with good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What's more, it's the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or “least bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But it's not entirely clear to physicists that this is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at an important physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still needed to be completely sure.
In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of making mistakes seem small. We'll see what it's all about.
There is, in this big world, a generalized and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that there is also such a law in it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state”; a “state” that consists, roughly speaking, of some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find good citizens called Fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other hand, there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories website The Particle Adventure, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and “force particles”, through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the “particle of light” that acts as a “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
In effect, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disorders” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this “disorder” an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing other than a photon; that is, one of the “force-carrying” bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be “disordered” for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
That's why we need an immense particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the large hadron collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never remain glued to a refrigerator door by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (such as the photon, by the way), do not.
But what can all these investigations “contribute”? , asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently want them to be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a “new physics” that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as that it does not propose any explanation related to gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (another oops!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our daily lives are difficult to predict, but we don't think we're wrong to say that it won't have any.
Just so you can see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in laboratories had absolutely no suspicion of the revolution that their work would provoke.
They glimpsed scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, has already said, at first the laser was more of a “laboratory device”.
Just imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this sensor now serves as an “eye” for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The Best Way to Die... | Le Devoir
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in La Montégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
“They had given me five years to live, but I've been like this for seven,” he says, pausing, lying on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has taken its toll on him: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts that they help him eat.
Courageous, he even smiles, talks to strangers who give him attention, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to have my diarrhea cured, it's humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for that disease.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses that surround them no longer offer “curative” care.
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die “conscious and drowned”.
But the disease has made her children discover it.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I have no more desires left in this life,” she says, before accepting that a mask be put on to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a final visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and nutrition assistance.
It's palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center's doctors.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the demand.
Diabetics no longer have their sugar levels under control.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, his son ran out of beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois Center, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old boy dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two children, after having tried everything to survive.
“For six months now, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 with cancer,” Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of the patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in caring for patients with cancer.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences in palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before they agree to proceed with euthanasia.
“Recently,” she says, “I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room suffering great pain without what was necessary to alleviate her.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don't get the right care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already low when she left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” he says.
“However, she had told me that there was nothing more to do!”
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to put the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the disease that has not been alleviated will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn't necessarily mean “I want euthanasia”, but “I want to be relieved”.
This report was made possible thanks to a journalism grant from health research institutes in Canada.
Widespread real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the road network, businessmen from the BTP, fund-raisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable “system”, which includes the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters.
An “industry” that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It's curious how the system is pulverized once we've hunted down the big media,” ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The “Duchesneau report” established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, while hoping to be able to “demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government auditors, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police officers of “the Marteau Squad”, who, since 2009, have moderated the “sewer cartel” in Montreal when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been serially recording accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city in the suburbs.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
It is suspected that he has been pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambit, have been formally accused.
The latter has caused a shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the “system” for obtaining public contracts.
For three years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambit distributed money left and right during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from companies in the construction sector totaling 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills by 30% and 40% as false extras.
In addition, an organizer from the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and brought Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, since 2010, she opposed the sale of municipal land purchased for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million dollars to developers in the middle of the real estate boom.
70% of the money from election campaigns was dirty money
Of the research that will finally be carried out, she says that she pulls “by a thread in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits”.
He adds that the process is “painful, but positive”.
We are cleaning up the wounds, but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and we would need to be very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is mainly concerned about the role of “" elected politicians aware of the ploy”.
Estimating the proportion of dirty money that went to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he ironizes: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but that will not change the donation, according to him, “as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It recommends a complete review of the system for granting public contracts and funding parties: “we cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws.”
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
“PSG is not FC Barcelona!”
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I move forward from day to day by your side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a match, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't get too hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pretraining center to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing games at a very high level.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect from all technicians.
Nowadays, there is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The trust he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken away the position of leader from us.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
To begin with, we want to finish first in our league against Porto in order to receive the return of the round of 16.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is dedicated to its resources to bring this project to fruition.
Would not winning the cup in Ligue 1, as in last season, constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in winning that title of champions.
In the last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It's normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home against Troyes, still having things to blame us for is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the round of 16, and they too have invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points ahead of the day.
That would be to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which weren't doing well last season, have been “boosted” by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say that we have a “Zlatandependency”.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that he scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he has been through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good games in the national team.
This is what I expected since my baptism with the “Bleus”.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why today we have exemplary behavior.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the helm of the “Bleus”?
It's getting results.
They are well placed in the World Cup qualification group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires them to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will take the national team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, paying and selling without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, the transactions identified and the processing burdens between the parties.
In addition, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files on a peer-to-peer basis.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And nearly a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching the peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before returning to around ten dollars today (the quotes are registered on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It's not impressive at all when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency”, “that competes with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and that can be earned playing or can be purchased (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously ledger repositories, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are recorded in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This involves solving a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file shredding, that is, of transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical fingerprint.
The computers “take” the new transaction and add a number before “chopping” the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular fingerprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is regularly split in two, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
Network life already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
“The flaw used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Major players such as Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that close to 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, the “giant sales” were launched.
“$30,000 was exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The bearer also manages their identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a telephone can “photograph and recognize”, says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, should this currency be successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back possession of its territory and for Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
Above all, we have punished Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus those wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also on peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without being attacked, under surveillance by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul after the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was shrouded in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing government land to resell as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, while benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them haven't fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They have experienced the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With around 65% of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish brochures that present a modern world have big fans all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the position of prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country had been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to get hold of them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to re-establish their normal relations.
French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to “win hearts and spirits” and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a “civil and military actions” service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These jobs, eager to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and an increase in cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small amount of civil aid, well controlled and that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing for President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever when it comes to the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives him full powers, he decided to play everything for everything.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given that Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial embezzlements.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delusion” and continues to “betray his word” and “trample on the law”.
On the part of his supporters, he assures that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks haVOC throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: “either they vote on my text or I maintain full powers”, powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted on were unanimously voted on.
The commentators are amused, on the other hand, by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at prayer time, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all eyes, is finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that “the principles” could be replaced by “the rules”, which would have allowed for a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their good will and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider that it is nothing more than a publicity ruse.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with Sharia laws.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because “the people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy”.
Liberals' fears are also increased by the fact that the next president of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we are within the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity surrounding article 220, since the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
“We refer specifically to the term qih [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could arise in the future would be to what extent are civil judges competent to rule above all of this.”
Beyond its religious nature, the text voted on yesterday has received many criticisms referring to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to what they were under the previous regime.
Another sticking point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the Defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by associations for the defense of human rights.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy continues and, henceforth, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to appear on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
The Jordan River where Jesus was baptized is well worth a visit.
It is believed that anyone who enters this “baptismal font” will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, the easing of the storm and the full nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin “Via Dolorosa”).
It begins at the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, it goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the Christian navel, symbolic of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for Jews, the Western Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will later come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of Fortress Masada were what was left of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to be built in 25 BC. C. for your family.
They are found on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are dedicated to climbing can get there by their own means.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, bus services are available from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited at the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In a single trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
The Art Museum in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.
His exhibition of paintings includes canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bathhouse museum, which are some rooms of old Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers from that time.
In Caesarea, it's worth visiting the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Cheers
Israel's three main tourist areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they swim even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that can easily hold even those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing mud and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of ancient times
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the Citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous maritime route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your “same” symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, “take” the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you are traveling to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to be carried in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shequels (currently 1-3$.8 shequels).
Urban transport mainly consists of buses, but in Jerusalem there are fast trams and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City to the Upper City.
It's actually from an underground funicular.
Traveling by any type of public transport costs 6 shequels and for this price you can travel by transferring for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning, a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, shellfish, fish without scales, and dishes that combine milk and meat.
It offers a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
Stray dogs are not seen on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that “walk as they please” in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love busy places and don't turn down goodies.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, which costs $15 a day.
And renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that is 51% higher than the same rate as in 2010, before the visa regime was canceled on February 9, 2011.
“The Great and Powerful” Will Take You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for the Language
While deputies and human rights defenders are arguing about the consequences of the law on compulsory testing, fraudsters have already appeared in the country who trade in “false” certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force, according to which every working immigrant must take an exam to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language exam, but also the exam on Russian history and the exam on the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are an exception.
Persons who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centers will be sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, and right now more than 160 centers of this type are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law took effect, managed to ask the press this question many times: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from “labor slavery”.
A lot of people are talking today about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of the cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, and those who do not know the language or pass medical supervision.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, take a “paid trip” to a creepy and cramped covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised salaries,” confirms the Head of the Labor Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be mad, little boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but that they also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don't even have anything to feed the children, let alone dress them, put them on shoes and buy them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's difficult, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
However, when it comes to the law on language, rights defenders make an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
“Welcome or forbidden to strangers”
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand rubles.
Russian police employees know that we generally carry false documents, we are not registered, and cases of extortion appear.
“They ask us for one hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,” the citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov, told reporters.
“Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting”
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several “false” certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought. Government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior is proposing to apply the law more rigidly in relation to the owners of weapons for civil use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Firing shots during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on possession of arms will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying a “heavy-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the internet, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of “senseless rigor” be desist.
The percentage of acts of vandalism involving the use of registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC news service in Russia.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed during the six months of 2012 with the use of firearms registered in interior bodies, compared to the total of 1168 crimes recorded for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the field of weapons for civil use will not hinder the criminal from going to the black market.
Now, according to his words, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for arms is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years old, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons
The first, “vestige of the army or military”, that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officials and by Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of “black weapon”, those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those directly stolen by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were set deliberately to cover up the fault,” says a former military man.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers are also doing their bit.
“Now, private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market have proliferated and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including the one in Moscow,” says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“They have their own production there, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of arms,” explains the former soldier.
Where do weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supplying illegal arms to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and publicly accessible data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases are stolen during weapons production and 5% correspond to “illegal archaeology”.
The shop assistant at one of the gun stores, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a shipment.
Through an ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the registry and pass it over the fence.
“He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two magazines,” he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be complied with, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers,” adds the dependent.
“Like in a luxury boutique”
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
“I visited websites and blogs until a guy proposed that I go to the “Begovaya” platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a “little corner” where we could negotiate.
I only found out about the price of the gun there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
“To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts,” says the store clerk. “I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much.”
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to arrive there, let's say “from Mr. Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that his daughter's tooth had fallen out”.
I can even get a pair of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to give him away.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranets tested himself as a purchaser of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on this topic.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was “not everything”.
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a cat for a hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to “VKontakte” sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons “for different purposes”.
For this, no documents or personal meetings are required.
“It's enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the title of the advertisement “Buy a gun or machine gun.”
There, users place their orders and ask questions.
And do they sell to minors?
“Without permission, of course”, asks the user “Iván” (spelling preserved).
“I'm buying a TT gun. Moscow”, “Fedorenkov” laconically asks his question.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms with two hands.
And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military and former military commentator Viktor Baranets
I've heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the reach of Russian laws.
People place orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send him a photo and instructions so that he knows where the weapon is hidden,” says the press secretary of the NGO “The Right to Arms”, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets says that if you place an order online, you are left without a weapon and you are put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms with two hands.
“And people go, like hungry fish, to bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
On the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO “The Right to Arms”, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by mid-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics from the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the US go on strike
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at “McDonald's”
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low salaries paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as “McDonald's”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy's” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken”.
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and tame itself in its early stages.
The protest actions have the support of unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries received by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is to create unions of workers in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called “Black Friday”. On that day, the orgy of sales began in the United States, which captured millions of inhabitants, and which was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers from the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's stores, whose products are aimed at people with modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only on the job.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That “Black Friday”, the participants in the demonstration demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who earns $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than what you spend on salaries now.
If Walmart places the wage increase on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend a ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters are satisfied that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
“Black Friday” lasted in its stores from 8 in the afternoon on Thursday until midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on “Black Friday”.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that “fewer than five” Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than “another public relations stunt” organized by the workers' union.
“Free box!”
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not exactly the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and that is why there are none for now), but the “McDonald's” and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How is it possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers stopped by McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they were still living with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble upon interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal magazine, there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what to feed them with.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, in other words, that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and from punishing labor movement activists with tricks and dismissals.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it's easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Discordants
Loud protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular the city's City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work.”
The demonstrators received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as the city's mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support workers in the fast food sector so that they can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described by the New York Times, this has been the biggest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear if this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
“For now, fooling the brain isn't that easy”
The subject of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, has lately been perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it became known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the company's scientists, the glasses were already in the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been stuck in the phase of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with your finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of information technology must be freed to ours, to the physical world, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those dumb virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, it remains to be resolved the question of privacy, since we don't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not about loose movements, but rather shorter ones.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to hand you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Usually I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be really hard to recognize.
- In other words, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can precisely determine the person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, since they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives algorithm designers more work.
In other words, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps movements are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
An equivalent of such a device would be very useful for my work, but one that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And isn't there a need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three “cameras”, one of which is in fact the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the curvature and location of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone aloud in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a “transmutable” augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could go from glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (only you can see private things), but also their weakness: augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie “Iron Man”, but also to any mere mortal.
There's a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there's no tactile response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as an image support.
It records the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these “images in the air”. For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to what you would feel if someone were blowing on your fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels what it seems he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that they are going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those in gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, we still have to work for many years.
This is what makes working with virtual reality attractive for researchers, because many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the “Avant-Gardism of Saint Petersburg” project, dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
This list of the best includes brilliant figures from the St. Petersburg art and scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of “Rosbalt” is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden, or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely social-philosopher storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens smiles in the inhabitants and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took his hands on an organ and became the organ maker of Saint Petersburg, since he has matured to play such a difficult role, due to his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around town dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the image-makers and society.
However, in society, anything that is not a little gray causes aggressiveness and agitation from properties that are not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with the later ones that were being exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to “Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got involved in theater because of the clothes, the music of all genres, but not because of the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no renovations, there existed an artistic musical club, a bohemian club, the house of Saint Petersburg's bohemia.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought “La Oreja de Van Gogh” to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under a phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became “Leningrad”.
Trachtenberg was the animator of many programs before the time of Hali-Galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; he received basic education and training from us.
Gallery “D 137", the “Griboyedov Club”, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was carried out in the press, the prize was “The People of Our City”.
In the “Artist of the Year” nomination, I was chosen, and that's how my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our time it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uncultured.
- There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, and they clearly express current events and events.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, “The Russian Museum in clowns”.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothes.
Now you are followed by your clothes, focusing on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps that person should not even shake hands, but rather spit in their face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organist. - A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to do it!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people were grouped in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons wanted another.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov, they come by the thousands!
- The abandoned ones will see it, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And 300 people go to a cultural event, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything wilts.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is it that St. Petersburg lacks?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: cultural official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right, everything was different, the kings might not have understood culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow there are now very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to correctly evaluate them and pave the way for them.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same is Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is Saint Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land there.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is negligible.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or colliding with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set out in search of a spare planet.
To conserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says the chief researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space began to be addressed with flora.
It's been half a century since experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
As a result, we get a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, it must stand on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks would do random somersaults.
And after 10 hours the newborns had a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we managed to get the chicks to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them,” says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological “miniarch” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only species of the same sex will travel on the “Bion” biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is capable of creating an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was passed by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only a year after the flight to space, did the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, give birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
There are few of us, there are few astronauts for whom everything has worked out well after long flights, and a healthy generation is growing.
“And if I can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights,” summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in preparing for the flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is their native element.
Little amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on Earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, since it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget anything,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women, gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrease very quickly, and the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, which will push you.
“And then what?” , Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is impossible to dress a newborn in orbit in a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unadapted person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space.
Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the “Švarc” system has not found the guilty politician
In terms of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is lame.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
“The law will never be perfect”, but its application must be correct. “This is, in my opinion, what we are missing”, that is how he describes the current situation.
The joint checks by the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the “švarc” system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither can the president of the government prevent the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or require obligations,” Kala says.
At the meeting of the oversight committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, within the framework of which the legislation relating to public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started carrying out about two years ago.
In a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public awards should be organized, followed by the legislation in force in each country and, later, by the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet been finalized, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation in our country is “stricter and more complete”, however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly stringent rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely a common control of this type could help us to stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable price (which doesn't always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But the fact that reducing the award limit does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much “paperwork”, that those who want to look for faults in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems in our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
As for offices, such as the NKÚ, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent similar, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of auditors are even at this level. In this respect, it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I wouldn't want to establish a comparison without concrete data. However, Germany is still a model in some ways, but it is not possible to pinpoint exactly where it is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Of course not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a great number of problems.
If that weren't the case, it wouldn't benefit them to collaborate with our office, don't you think?
As for our country's legislation, what did the amendment to the law on public awards mean for your Office? Is its incidence manifested in any way?
Taking into account that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, a certain delay is necessary.
For now, we can see the process of preparing future controls: we have launched a new tool for “detecting non-economic risks”, through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process and the like are rectified.
Do you consider that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it represents an obstacle for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope that will be the case.
The problem that can arise is that the regulations “get tougher” and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programs of the regional council), and every law not respected in the area of public awards meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this journey that has begun takes us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother businessmen with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the “švarc” system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the Office from acting, which has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say, “We changed the law and allowed it,” but you can't say that we'll do as if nothing happened.
In the law on public awards, the regulations are quite strict as to how one should act formally. And that's how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded because they do not meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice sheets, although most of them are passable
In several parts of the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plaques.
Although most roads are passable, some roads must be taken with extreme caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they had ice and snow sheets.
The temperature drops and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day, the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low-lying areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the crests of the Ore Mountains, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor because of fog, according to information from the region's highway operations control center.
The R6 highway and the first-class highway in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
In addition, all second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still sections with traces of ice and crushed snow.
There is a need for increased attention on the road, especially in higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in Eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on mountain roads from Krkonoše to Orlické Hory.
There is a layer of snow flattened on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of Eastern Bohemia, today the sky will be between clear and partly cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally range from three below zero to a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although extreme caution must be taken and will need to be adapted to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places, drivers will find fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what emerges from information from the region's road operations control center.
The D5 highway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany, there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category roads are wet, so in this case, there are also sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less traveled roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road in the direction of Videlský Kříž.
Road operators removed snow during the night; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
“In the higher areas of the Šumper road, there are traces of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will encounter half-discarded snow in the direction of Jeseník,” an operator from the Šumper road administration confirmed today to ČTK.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also came to Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road, the roads are passable without restrictions; on the Šternberská road, drivers should drive with caution on forest stretches, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in North Bohemia have reported complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures stay below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech Massif Central, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
For the time being, there have been no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day, rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From general roads, unfavourable conditions have been announced on highway I/13, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by tree branches that had arched over the road under the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of many other alarmist news that we like to hold on to.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this rather, and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you are organizing a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set out for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way of supporting us.
The group The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled “End of the World, Canceled”.
It's currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at benefit concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last one, well, as long as everything works out and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The hymns will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the music video, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We even work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts against the end of the world go to?
Equipment for the Studeo barrier-free educational center, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The students of the Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to create a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar “spectacular action” planned in the future?
In May we will be performing for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist. Until now you have acted, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How are the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still uncommon for a person to move around the city center alone in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, is not there.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to discuss the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects where we are lagging behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid, it is very normal for people with serious disabilities to travel on their own in public and to be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap, we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, everything will begin to change for real.
Until now, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I joined Jedličkův ústav as an educator, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, popularity didn't come until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It's true that connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group helped us a lot.
We came to the conclusion that work that cannot be seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to aid from the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something could be done differently.
The world of show business is full of things that look like each other.
It's logical, in its own way, everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are capable of living a full life and developing themselves, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out for people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you're a demanding boss help, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand a certain discipline.
I think that's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they find out that they have to attend two days to rehears, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and at concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, it can't be helped.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and at Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song by the group The Tap Tap “End of the World, Canceled”
The purpose of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old get free admission to the pre-sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers from the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member country of ESA in the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years it participated in the agency's project committee.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already involved in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld's conference at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study “Introduction to Cosmonautics”.
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his “Introduction to Cosmonautics”.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a dresina was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known either.
It is not clear if the rocket was going to be used to start the resin or to brake it.
Information on this resin is limited to that collected in the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, Polish artillery began to focus on missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslavem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study “Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomb lotnicza”, by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all the projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future perspectives.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was finalized in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not weigh 5 kg.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959, aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control high winds.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were differentiated from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C it was 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km above sea level.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
Suspending the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court suspended the Social Work Act.
The resolution aroused a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor costs (of salaries) causes economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so “causes a drop” in the competitor's price with the aim of taking over most of the market and, in this way, increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying there cheaper, or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the state's social spending necessarily increases.
This whole situation favors the total disinterest of businessmen in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their desire to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and, in this way, attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population regardless of social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in existing laws.
The objective is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to salaries.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labor rights.
The result is growing poverty along with a widening gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid has now reached 1 million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly common case occurs: people employed with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The savings measures of practically all the states in the south of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live on a terrible salary on the limits of society, in the hope that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Do we need to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media state ad nauseam that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask ourselves if private capital does not, with its selfishness, influence the political march and, therefore, on the entire state.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in every state.
The result is a desperate situation that is manifested in the area of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial resources, entrust the drafting of bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then approved by the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like the one described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic at the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: “The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations were occupied by force”.
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unimpeded and people went to the polls with the vote spoken beforehand”... “there were no people with character who would aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state went without consuls for eight months”... “There began to be serious talk that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man”... Although Appiános was thinking of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on inconsiderate preferences for individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as it was then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
Suspending the law on public awards is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution involves concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and that weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
“That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could” (Nothing comes from violence and nothing could do it), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads “Let's don't forget how fragile we are” (let's not forget how fragile we are).
“If my children didn't want wars, there wouldn't be any” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, diverse reactions have arisen.
One, on the Israeli side, argues for the right to self-defense and pigeonholes Palestinians into the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and calls Israel a terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated periodically and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who is taking advantage of the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated on the basis of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have arrived at based on my own way of understanding the issue, about who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of struggles for power is in the front row.
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps independently or if behind their throne there was someone who guided their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, could not be reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 90s of the 19th century, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) so that they would stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, had their backs covered their backs, something that for them always meant strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack in Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has made the central bank subject to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschild Bank of America central bank, began printing money during the Civil War and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan for three world wars, designed by the freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war aimed to eliminate large monarchical states throughout Europe; the second one wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Great Britain, and the third one aimed to reduce the Earth's population between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves would suffice for their well-being and luxury and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the onset of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like the one in 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the First World War broke out as a result, they destroyed tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to covertly create a conflictual situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Later, it was enough for them to serve the Germans the Führer's solution, which was strong and simple enough and pointed out the culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represented the function of the fifth column so well, that it ignited the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it's hard to know if Hitler pulled too much of the rope that international bankers had tied him to in the beginning or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers were able to start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim on the front lines of combat, now together with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let's take as an example how Israel's supporters and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything there was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all the world's oil passes (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy .
In what light are the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 now displayed: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in their imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual has a chip implanted at birth that controls their entire being.
“And it forces everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and enslaved, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers in his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two toes in front, should add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If It Gets Crude, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a demonstration group of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive outlook: throwing the Shah overboard could not be allowed to do so, since, if it did, it jeopardized the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was subsequently further intensified by the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the US, their fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran decisively contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film “Argo” by director and actor Ben Affleck focuses on an episode of this story, which achieved a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a difficult journey, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran. For this purpose, a covert story helped, an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction blockbuster.
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
The details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called “caper movie”, the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example could be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film, moods are combined. On the one hand, we found well-documented footage from Tehran. The sequence of credits shows emblematic photographs from the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes that are somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after “Goodbye Little, Goodbye” (2007) and the thriller “The Town. City of Thieves” (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which the action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
In addition, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates this in Argo, where Tehran is “filmed” in Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive because of its synoptic capacity, which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he copes quite well. Sometimes it adds something to reality: everything doesn't come out so elegantly here (the scene where the crisis lurks at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its runway become crazy).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play a very funny role as collaborators in Hollywood, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a little dramatic touch, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, evaluating its production and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But for it to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, that's enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the competition on “the most absurd regulations or ideas of the EU workshop”.
“It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in management positions in large European companies,” explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women took advantage of better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher reported.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline on the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual prohibition of using the expression “butter spread” or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest-quality bananas in the EU should be at least 14 centimeters long and could not have “abnormal curvatures”.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize national standards that have not been homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been relaxed on the basis that the existing directive entails food waste.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year's EU prescription according to which inflatable balloons that are marketed must warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death due to asphyxiation.
A similar restriction is also in force applicable to the use of mothers-in-law by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are even born in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia. In order not to hurt Greece's sensibilities, we should talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don't have a sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation,” then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said in the fall of 2004.
He argued this with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for drafting applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member states' guidelines are often the target of criticism, and the EU's regulatory efforts and, in addition, more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that member states have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs also have a nerve, like other countries in the Union, in the fight for the right to the denomination of origin of their traditional products, even if our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the denomination of origin of Olomouc cottage cheese, but they had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed “tuzemák”.
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin in the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known all over the world, the marzipan from the German city Lübeck or the ham from Parma, there are, for example, cookies from Karlovy Vary, the carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the hop variety from Žatec.
As protected gangs of the EU, they can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Hořice v Podkrkonoší wafers.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you think of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything were fine in our country, then I would not submit my candidacy.
But I can't bear to see how thieves are being stolen in the last twenty years in our country anymore, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and the retirement age increase.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am now forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have of changing things is to run as senator or president.
He has already arrived at the Senate, but soon after he set out on his way to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I specified that if I were elected senator, I would present my candidacy for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
That's why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we are stomping on anyone who wants to initiate change.
Added to this are the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He presents himself to the presidential fight with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property in excess of twenty million.
To do this, the law must change.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group to have the profession of guide recognized as autonomous work, and we succeeded.
The problem lies in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is purposely rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without pigeonholing or party dogmas, I have the capacity to be able to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left-wing or a little right-wing.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don't care if someone is from the right or the left, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
You're joking when people say you're a populist.
But aren't you proving that with what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain objectives and ideals.
And you try to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without the support of the parliament, he has only slogans left.
And with that, it cannot survive in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will achieve, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to do my part to achieve this.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimate criminal and financial liability for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want to.
If there is a strong character who points out the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I'm just starting out in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to move things forward myself, but if it doesn't work out, in six years I will leave it and return to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that I don't do anything with a person, that's why I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might dare to present their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the light heating oil frauds.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I am in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did voted for representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are two from the independent sector.
The people elected the senate, so it will be difficult to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the flawless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
Talk about property declarations, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have land valued at 25 million, an apartment valued at ten million, another apartment valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I have already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there isn't much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live on it. For example, I couldn't afford to pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run for office.
So you will continue with your business activity in order to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As promised, I have partly given up my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn per month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I continue to earn.
If I were president, then I would leave business.

The architectural studio MVRDV shows that real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently finished “mountain of books” - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there's finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a bystander passing by the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “besides, the building is nice”.
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody gets into those old fashioned libraries for fun, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town on the outskirts of Rotterdam that is hardly worth a fleeting visit, has the dubious honor of having won a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And that's how policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun and cynical buildings, took up the subject with her usual serenity and attended the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smile on her face.
And while the jury looked around in perplexity and shrugged their shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size in a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: “Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for Spijkenisse's mountain of books, the so-called 'Boekenberg'”.
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises where it was intended.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed by an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouses.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was awarded the second prize “Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the “Dutch National Wood Award 2012”.
In this way, the small city devoid of history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white façade one would rather guess a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain range, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but rather prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the annealed brick floor and the elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up, you can see the benches in the park, the dogs and the boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Book shelves are usually arranged along the façade and in the center there is a huge dark room that, in general, tends to be somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves, which assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, on a Frisian farm, we stumbled upon the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands have been using plastic fabric a few millimeters thick as a base to support the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts for two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until four centimeter thick plates were obtained.
Under heat and pressure, so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mix of a new car and a sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us: not only do you have a fantastic view of the city from the cafeteria, but there you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it's hard to believe, given its large glass areas, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,” Trouborst points out.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines inside it for only a few hours.
The huge wooden trusses located transversely to the glass façade serve to provide shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is up to automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Likewise, professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde visited the library. She describes the “Boekenberg” as Spijkenisse's “late soul”.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for now, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has taken a deep dive.
The shelves are full.
“There's nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our initiative, all the inhabitants now have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved great success in that discipline that in specialized jargon is known as “creating an identity”.
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
Regardless of how young and uncultured he may be.
Finally, a starting point for shaping your identity.
Szabo: “The Germans must play a greater role”
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US relations. UU. -Europe, this places Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany implied that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of United Nations observer State.
However, in the end, Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is currently refocusing its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think that they are still trying out what their role will be, but they have already started the path to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy actually mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and for that reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with respect to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not alienated from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it so much importance since it's not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States? Department of State by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps by doing so, Germany has managed to earn itself a certain respect.
After all, all this has only demonstrated that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the U.S. The US has been clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the United States? U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of US domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration secretly shows a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I think that the real disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if there were a coherent and homogenous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must push things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky topic.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or is it perhaps still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany hasn't gotten used to it yet, it's always a little uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and that is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
The influence of the U.S. The United States in European politics is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not filling that gap for now, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant, or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, c'est la vie!

“Brand protection” in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a denomination officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it's not clear that they will be proved right.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specializes in violations of protective rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters in order to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copying themselves in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats in the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey department stores dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the Pattloch cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it “Bang Ming Pai” or companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term “Bang Dakuan”,
which refers to women who have “catfished” a rich man.
Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
“It's bad for business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand is running low, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millions of dollars, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the one that is growing at the fastest rate.
However, achieving the cancellation of dubious legal registrations in the trademark registry is difficult and also involves a lot of money.
The processes can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had passed that the name that was the subject of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality”.
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarizer because the process has damaged the plagiarizer's brand in China,” Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently taken over by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction from the original.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal”.
As a result, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is often the case in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection requests, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and it means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each entry costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese impersonator in court.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation auto parts,
the copycat has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the Munichs' appeal.
In the next two instances, they proved Freudenberg right, but the opposing side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time”.
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a “six-figure sum in euros” with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers that lurk in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
specifically if imitators secure their rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg in Germany for shoes and leather products.
The group abandoned this commercial area some time ago, however it managed to prevent enrollment.
“You have to be really careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international legislation on trademark rights, but what needs to be done is to “also register in China everything that may be susceptible to protection”, as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the theme can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg were to lose the last round of his private battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party licensing fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would push us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the orphans of AIDS rejoice
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First, it starts with dancing: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high-heeled shoes and loafers search for the compass on the parquet floor, and they quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers' voices (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to slowly rise up, getting in the way and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost go out of his way by trying to bring order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the housewife.
“Om'Obani” is not an easy piece, each voice in the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations programme for the fight against AIDS, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans in the town of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, the uniform and will guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means “storyteller” or “panegyrist” in Zulu.
Nobody in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For ten years, this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: Southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancies in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not welcome circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at the age of just over thirty has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this remote town, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than slim.
Initially, it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association “Voices for Africa”, which since then has been professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonads, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively rare; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years old.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often don't cause pain or cause other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they don't offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change your sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any delayed consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for its performances throughout Germany, they raise quite a lot of money.
“In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association, proudly.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find good housing, for example with one of their grandmothers.
The “gogos”, as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in and ensure that children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, “Voices of Africa” has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has ensured that many of the inhabitants of the town have undergone an HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite how evident this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, “On any corner you can get free condoms, but they are hardly used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years to Southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear a couple of tears out of the odd angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town barely appears on maps, it is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
“Come closer to Esitjeni, the light shines there,” say the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the way, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is likely to be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the North American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, there is also icy water there, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal “Science”.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
Nobody relates the discovery of ice to the possibility that life exists on the planet, says Sean Solomon, the chief investigator of the Messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the Sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no “planet”.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a “family portrait” in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult thing to recognize is the pink color of “newborn” stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically named by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent image of an endangered star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the enormous Triffid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars form from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galaxy's star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as “The Seven Sisters”, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, colors can be better appreciated.
The Propeller Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in spectacular colors.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns in astronomy.
These are probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Swirling Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Triffid Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Triffida comes from the Latin term “trifidus” (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming area into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic star: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two galaxies in the process of merging rush towards each other and end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don't like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also constantly emerging; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suppose that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found mostly in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA. In the USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
It allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of alien life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the “Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence” (SETI), anyone who owns a computer can help, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea, it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission, 1,235 planet candidates had been located.
The image shows the last preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

A search for fingerprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus travels with a loud clap along the winding road that passes next to forested hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that you are in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The “Talyshi” live here, a town about which not much is known, apart from the fact that they are perfectly fluent in Persian and Azerbaijani and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture that may be too massive, designed in the Soviet era and that doesn't seem to fit quite into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, eight hours are needed because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to oil from the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the Oldest People in the World,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
The lives of eight dozen local talyshis who are over 100 years old are documented here. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his children died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently she still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
So has Şirali Müslümov been wrong about his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very old people also live,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registry either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of Talyshis.
Instead, the director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes that nutrition is the cause.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it doesn't seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the Talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter every day, is so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what he is in style in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she relentlessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
Two small children are also jumping from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that is served in typical domed glasses.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under her handkerchief she hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has maintained its color.
“I've never used a shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live on
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life I have never been shopping in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the era after World War II.
However, everything returned to its course when the “dear father”, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird on the lips of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan, the cult of the nation's father figure, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over the baton to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva earns 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount that can be lived well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray-haired son is right: “in our culture the elderly are highly respected.”
They live in a big family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if that wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression “Human Rights”
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalling demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is mired.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
“We must overcome the transition.
And for that to happen is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and the secular.
All of them, hopelessly mired so far in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his “in order to save the revolution”.
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour evening meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on “principles of Islamic law”.
However, what does “principles” mean?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for maneuver that comes with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: on all issues related to sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all of Sunni Islam.
This need not be the case, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that would - in fact - result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship, these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were being held in military prisons.
As stated in the draft, the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values”.
This formulation is so vague in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking, this is nothing more than censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering Prophet Mohammed and his legates.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits “offending people”
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and which, according to his words, “very soon” will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
“The revolution is back”
For weeks, the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday afternoon and vowed to overturn the Act before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the lists for the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be “in the dustbin of history”.
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy”.
“When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” says opponent Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for,” opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Quran is our constitution”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with veils and supporters of the Salafists took part in it, shouting: “the people demand the application of the divine law”.
They demanded that Morsi “clean up the country”, at the same time they proclaimed: “the Quran is our constitution”.
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It's obvious that Morsi's supporters didn't want to risk something like that happening.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now would have come the time to let the people decide at the polls what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamists' draft has the majority guaranteed.
“The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear”
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process, which in reality should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were being held in prison or had to face trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason, he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution,” she laments in a conversation with the newspaper “Welt am Sonntag”.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three branches of government led this lawyer to resign himself.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could backfire on you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “you are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.”
Norwegian Rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has anything to do with its hunger for an extremely smelly fish?
Eat a series of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, damp soccer clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing scent of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that can be fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you prefer it.
As it gets dark and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat it raw and then drink a glass of Aquavit in one gulp,” says Havard Halvarsen, a firefighter from the city who is also known as the “General of Rakfisk”, who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking significant quantities of the drink in one gulp.
“Some people like aquavit better than rakfisk,” Havard says.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, that's not bad; it's not much different from a piece of sushi that has been traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty hit Norway and when, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is well fermented, it is taken out and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mainly migrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high salaries and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants from Sweden, the old rival and until not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, if quite smelly, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A pint of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10€ ($14) each.
Norway is not usually on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it that way.
People here are still unwilling to say the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who gunned down and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22nd event.”
Norwegians have a hard time believing that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn't the only reason why we're doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she passes Rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde hair and surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, prudent people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don't like to brag, we don't like to show off.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything, except for a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money that they didn't have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy,” Anna says.
“And eat rakfisk,” he adds with an unwrapped laugh.
I'm in the snow waiting in line for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is undoubtedly something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that stinky fish returns.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a Rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a presenter who wears a bow tie and who is surrounded by Rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
“What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?”
“Here's our score, Havard.”
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps beaten by the Aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges that the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
It is faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government is deeply committed to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
“I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before rubbing shoulders with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, that of Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state that surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it for the growth of local tourism and for the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city, you can drive along one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new highways, which represents an enormous improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were renovated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We trust that he will be able to achieve real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
“In particular, when it comes to security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's qualification of the lack of essence of the new president.
“He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic statesman and, above all, he's a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state, that is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo couldn't be greater.
Tucked away under elevated stretches of highway, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
Earlier this year, the intervention of the military was called for to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuses their administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make an effort to hold back her tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been cleaned,” Mrs. Buendía recalls.
“There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared.”
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and to shut up.”
“But that can't be the case when there have been so many wrongdoing and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term in office.
“I hope he's the same type of president he was when he was governor,” says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning during his time in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's time at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of confidential information in United States history, lost multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while under military detention.
During the prosecution's interrogation of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein stated that the records of weekly visits from officers of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing held following the defense's request that the case be dismissed because his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was incarcerated under maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers allegedly asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the warders as “excellent” and the treatment received at the facility in general as “very professional.”
The forms don't show any allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had talked about those problems and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the registry.
“They would write 'no incident' (after talking about the problems) but that doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't have mentioned any problems,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he hadn't reported the treatment he was receiving during the January 2011 meeting with a council charged with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the “injury prevention” regime under which he was.
The military said they had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is one degree below surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the general staff to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so that I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning explained Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning said that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of his days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said that he always had light from outside pointing at his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that he would turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday's statement, according to which, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning recount to stand naked in front of warders and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the recount.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that she deduced from the order given to her by the warden that she should drop the blanket with which she could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered her to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his underwear or his flip flops to harm himself but that he hadn't.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, flip flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he were convicted in the court-martial, which is due to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is due to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules applicable to any detainee in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If found guilty on all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He states that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely walked down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and I was already totally confused.
Some signs indicated the way to two queues: one for “Mexicans” and the other for “Foreigners”.
I stayed there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I have been called “Mexican” throughout my life.
This is ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York describe themselves as “Italian”.
Later I decided on “Mexican-American”.
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts weren't necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native speaker and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought of that time this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda for the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is currently as likely to stay in Mexico as to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a United States official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And Moctezuma's children stand up in arms.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really represents quite a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Are we talking about bitterness?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom this is not the case.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who had to leave the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican dream.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans who belong to the elite of the ruling class don't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we were from a lower category that isn't Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either of them.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best from each country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even more, from what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as impromptu “ambassadors” for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not going to happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure that it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful about how their families were treated much, much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more “Mexican” than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the futile and usual discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their deadly deadlock situation could be unraveled.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week's clashes have reinforced falcons on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has governed Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has taken a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to put an end to Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its relentless rivals from Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time is in their favor.
As Islamists have been gaining influence across the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The exultant members of Hamas say that the Islamist half moon is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the militia-party Hezbollah dominates, through Syria, where rebels with an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populated and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn't have much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military question is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven effective and many of Hamas's missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep more peacefully... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel hasn't had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase even though, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the elections on January 22, is in a good position.
Why pamper these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good hit if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter their calculations.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere don't have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area's superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire bodes well and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus exploded this week in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography is worsening the situation as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution is still the one being touted by wise people on both sides, most of them from the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the flow of arms into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs unaware of the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back at the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude represents a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases appear on dull green packs, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a dull olive green wrapper, appalling images of parts of the body with diseases and depictions of children and babies sick because they are the children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of font.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
Australia's federal government says the goal is to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
Trust studies that show that if a person hasn't started smoking before the age of 26, there's a 99% chance that they never will.
“You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco, in Australia.
The amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia will increase.
Other people say that their business has benefited after the law was passed.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for silicone cigarette cases and covers to cover up the unpleasant images on the packs had skyrocketed almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and that she was waiting for more stocks.
“For us it's good business.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws that prohibit television advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most retailers not to put cigarettes in plain sight, tobacco marketing has now taken place online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but it cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you sell tobacco and you only have this small window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman saw an increase in brand reviews from “ordinary citizens” published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if he is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new regulations entail than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; these countries are stating before the World Trade Organization that trade is being unjustly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images in packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them.”
“You pick up the cigarette and keep the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with an image of a tumor in his mouth.
“Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packs make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
“It normally took an hour to unpack a delivery; now it takes four hours,” says Yu.
“The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we closed the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During the Thanksgiving holiday this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have ways to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free stores.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it's okay for both us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Being bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don't experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Yes.
And no.
But, we'll talk about that later.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as stated by Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book “Boredom: A Lively History” (“Boredom, a Lively History”) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, this is not the case.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom that date back to the first century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and presenting the idea to a discussion group made up of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “wanting, but not being able to, participate in an activity that fills you up”.
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn't do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly”.
Boredom can sound awfully similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider that they have the problem.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what's really happening to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention”, published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to a television program at full volume in the next room that was not related, others listened to it at a low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group never heard the audio.
The group that listened to the program at low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was difficult for them to concentrate, but they weren't sure why and they attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the alteration of attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
“On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting faulty parts on a manufacturing line, distracting music can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we now know that moving or doodling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, since they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to be bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a “boredom tendency scale” in the 80s.
The scale includes questions such as “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do everything”.
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys are more likely to be bored more often than girls, and specifically they need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if today's boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that “adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels”, largely because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it isn't, since, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to be exposed to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into substance use as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, you might be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to be dosed applies to other situations,” he says.
Not only does your child learn to be entertained on their own, but they learn to control themselves better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to be more bored, but boredom is a desire that is too distressing and disturbing to be related to anything worthwhile,” he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy some downtime.
“In an environment where we're constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it's difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise ceases.”
Colorado: No instruction book for the new law on marijuana use
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: the possession of marijuana stones and a pipe that he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize possession of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor crimes for possession of marijuana are being overturned both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped bringing charges against those over 21 years old for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors from more conservative districts in Colorado have pledged to move forward with open cases for possession of marijuana and are still subpoena people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent newly licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All of this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also thinking about the matter.
And they are still seeking advice to establish a licensing system for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales, all before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states when it comes to regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent to serve as a model for us,” he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which we will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of conducting cannabis businesses within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, children's play areas or children's centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Oates, the Aurora police chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop bringing lawsuits for minor misdemeanors for possession of marijuana against people over 21 years of age and that the police would stop bringing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's regulations that regulate the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to pressure consumers into deciding to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against misdemeanors that were criminal offences at the time they occurred,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer cites adults for possession of small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and the judicial system was never considered to be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise across the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with district attorneys,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Law.
“They've spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, they still can't accept that it's legal,” he said.
As the first states to consider small quantities of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they are also looking forward to receiving guidance from the federal government, which still expects the sale and cultivation of marijuana to be considered as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana are hoping that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed businesses selling marijuana for these purposes to exist in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“Although drug agents probably won't break down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will probably be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
“We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for.”
A lot of questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: “I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory”
University students aren't attacked for their views just now
I can't remember a time in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been to what I supposed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary Greek symposium that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after taking my place at Worcester College in the late 80s to study History, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and burst into tears.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper stated that I had dropped out because I didn't tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because they forced me to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less fun.
I fled from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subject to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my quirky name, not because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for only one reason, which in the cradle of the supposed Enlightenment was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a leading advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You may be wondering what that's coming up for now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of students from the Conservative Party is such that, last week, a group of them called for the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (undergraduate student group) of Corpus Christi College say that they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as unwelcome people” because of their political ideas.
They want to create a seat on the equal opportunities committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right” (Paradise: Young, Bright and on the Right) about student politics, which presented the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a walking stick with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are treated like “scapegoats” because of the introduction of higher tuition rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and vice-president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing left-wing tendency in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is “uncomfortable”, while Stephanie Cherill, 19, and elected president of the OUCA, says that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are from the center right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986. I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hate for the Conservative Party was at an all-time high.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an “honorary degree” after cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with horror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students met and the professors, I received a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery that was made of conservative university students, but that they were willing to participate in it.
The politics of the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminary.
The first one I attended had to be translated into English French texts from the 18th century and I wasn't prepared for what came next.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
Don't say a single one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew very well how to expel bad bile.
“Are Thatcherists refusing to learn French, or are they simply dumb?” , he asked.
The other university students laughed.
My eyes burned from the tears I was trying to hold back.
“I suggest that you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people,” Pitt growled.
I returned to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinnertime at the university; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he told me kindly.
“I'm afraid that's how it's going.
They mess with anyone suspected of being Tory.
It's very difficult for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.
A lot of newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour.”
Later on, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to disguise.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved futile.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated.”
Other students adopted that little tune.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” , one asked.
“They beat each other up, don't they?”
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 60s.
Could I one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people who thought like me only after nightfall?
Would I have to become a Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History assigned to my university college.
They hated him because he was not only a member of the Conservative party, but also an advisor to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches for him.
It was barely around there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You're not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I began to commute daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded, metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
“But if it's the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His sore eyes started to blur.
“Give it another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you left him.”
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of History had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
Red with embarrassment inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” me and called them “stupid old men”.
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
Back then, my father was writing two weekly columns in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Maybe you'll call me a weeping weakling.
But no 18-year-old should be subject to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party but, to this day, is hiding behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety”
On the occasion of the exhibition “Valentino: Master of Sewing”, which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him during the inauguration of “Valentino: Master of Sewing”, a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his “maison” over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is “Il Signore” Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most granary of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a humble couturier from the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to an idol of the international “jet set”.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
“At least they don't put out the cigarette butts on your gorgeous rug like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we were both living in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains generously and elegantly.
“We all loved being invited to her chalet in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza doesn't forget the couturier's charisma either.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decor, the food, the music, in everything you could see and feel his spirit.
“He made each of the guests feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, who began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of style because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Alcurnia fashion show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous sixty meter-long runway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must walk down the runway to contemplate a dreamy “audience” that wears masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti used in “La Notte”, or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins, names such as Sibylla from Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia from Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like their first love, “impossible to forget”.
I remember it perfectly.
It was pants, a shirt, a “Gillette” vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
“It was a gift that he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
“I prefer him over others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty”, adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and are “donors” to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamt of being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of her evening gowns...
The time finally arrived at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a frilled skirt, a draped “corsage” and a brideshow neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her couturier's party dresses with “the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it's also the set of memories it entails”.
The “king” of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory-colored silk suit inlaid with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority in the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, “the return of female customers from high society”.
Overshrouded for years with the “savoir-être” of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has accumulated as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
“I've always been struck by their refinement, their calm, their neat and perfect appearance,” D'Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
“It was immaculate, time doesn't pass for him.”
If a princess says so...
The toughest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with air.
After tearing up large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb at a snail's pace, keeping their balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall off the cliff.
They know that any setback could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell down the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, painstakingly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for every kilo of sulfur.
He then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
“Since it's normal to carry 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three daily transfers.
It takes three hours each and it ends up ground, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery for such an inhumane effort, it is triple what I would earn on the field.
“The miners' wage is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the porter, who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the slash wasn't as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a weighty reason that, in Indonesia, is as overwhelming as sulfur: “I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam.”
Anto has asthma, breathes hard, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At 27 years old, Anto has been playing his ass at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It's the price you must pay to achieve your dream.
“I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because sulfur doesn't stop flowing at night, when his characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater with light from a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 porters carry the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its enormous benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs, nor does it supply any equipment to the porters, who work on their own and at so much weight.
In fact, they don't even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that, together with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the rangers of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for beasts and not for people,” protests Madrusin, a stocky 42-year-old porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, she says she will endure working “as long as she can” because she needs the money to educate her three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps miners in the thick columns that emerge from the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious illnesses... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder sores, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues remove 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a goat path through the weeds.
“I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulfur.
Time goes by, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest jobs in the world: the one done by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“Singapore's population needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advertisement for peppermint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as “Let's put a bath (bun) in the oven” to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do “their national duty”.
This is purely an internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt that this was a topic we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, such as launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to write a rap?
1.2 children
The one that doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it's due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in singleness, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia in disguise abounds against many new immigrants, in particular Chinese immigrants, who are criticized for keeping salaries low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's governing party experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has come to control the number of small apartments, known as “shoe boxes”, that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that their “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hindered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district doesn't seem like they're going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so is education, so a lot of people are putting it off,” says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But it's important for me to have my own money and time,” says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of private or “the area of private life that one has the right to protect from any interference”.
What is private for a child under 16?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you're exposed to by airing situations on the Internet that you probably wouldn't share offline?
El Periódico interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, who are frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine”, on a personal level, and “in the username and password”, when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn't post my deepest secrets,” says Jorge, 10, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” she says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or images of games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or of someone who's making a fool of themselves,” he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the password to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly,” he says.
He doesn't hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would I listen to someone who recommended him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The adolescent has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, none of them have been insinuated or asked for his home address or telephone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded it from me, I just took them out of my account,” he admits.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
“He never knew who he was,” he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
“He just gave it privacy.”
It then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, he would, if I don't like him or feel like it.
“Although I know that's cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game changed,” he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, “because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what should or should not be disseminated, published or said at an age when maturity is not enough for that.”
“They should also be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn't work,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social networks,” he says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read social media policies conscientiously.
By understanding each of the paragraphs, they have a solid foundation for talking with their children about the implications of opening an online account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to Guardia, reminding children of the lesson of “don't talk to strangers” is key.
UNASUR Summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders, being made public.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially indicated that they would deliver it after the closing, but later stated that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content had been presented by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message “private session, restricted audio” was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was provided by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this is Humala's statement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated either.
On the official ASPA website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made every effort to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited the collection of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a decision of the Court of The Hague that would settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will abide by and execute the judgment that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,” Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the Brazilian presidents, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the event.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were established for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on residence.”
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the internet at low prices in all corners of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters together and efficiently.”
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of spaces in South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, and of good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal respectfully with the maritime dispute after a decision of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of that country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met beforehand to approve the Action Plan for the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense issues in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the last country has been suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenry”: Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans “killed themselves in the Second World War” and in other conflicts, “but now they are practically a homeland.”
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of UNASUR.
“We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers through any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those that have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
“It's incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under funding from the United States,” he said referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he is not sorry for that decision because by doing so he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his “profound democratic and human rights values.”
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for requiring him to submit to interrogation in his territory for an alleged sexual crime when “Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa stated that there is a risk of Assange's physical and mental health deteriorating.
“I haven't spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” said the Ecuadorian president.
What does exist is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health because you are locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
“That complicates anyone's health,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don't negotiate with human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
“The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances,” he said.
And he opined that “if Great Britain gives safe-conduct tomorrow, this will end”.
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will end.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and clarified that what he does not tolerate is “mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador,” and he said that if re-elected, “he will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path and in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup under the cover of legality” because in reality it “destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”
The Ecuadorian president also considered “perfectly pertinent” the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate the maritime boundaries between the two countries with Nicaragua after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, that ruling is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed comprehensively in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also hoped for a successful conclusion of the maritime boundary litigation that Peru and Chile maintain in the same court and opined that “it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries are committed to accepting a judgment no matter how tough it may be.”
In reference to the possibility that he will run as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard.”
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I win it would be my last term in office and from there we left public life.
If we lose anyway.
“It's a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's new health treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that the campaign to return to Cuba was expected to pass.
“It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths due to AIDS today are a cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: positive for AIDS.
“It was as if a bomb fell on me,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make “softer”, with no obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; with such commitment that he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he had a cut”.
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked haVOC, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least among the first reported cases, “the great achievement means right now that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same,” said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after stating that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms “as long as they remain in control they will be able to live without problems until they are 75 years old,” the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths as of May of this year; however, it is said that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not one of access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication. The problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they are unaware of their infection status, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He gave a convincing fact: “Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection. What needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, screening tests have to be offered on a massive basis to all people who require it.”
Specialists and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for the test, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I'm going to die already, I'd better bust out three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was for the better, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who are afraid today, in the framework of World AIDS Day.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better and if they have already been diagnosed, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the motto of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Tapatio who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, “the distribution of condoms has indeed increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Adolescents are among those most vulnerable to new infections.
“What do you want them for?” It is a common question, with derision and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, said the communicator.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not just behind the counters and those hundred are found in public toilet dispensers in places where young people frequent.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying for the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González answered, when he asked him if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
“This is not sexuality, the best thing is to bring condoms closer to those who are already practicing sexual activity,” he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in cases of HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a United States appeals court a judgment that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any domestic company with branches in the neighboring country that has creditworthiness problems.
It would be said, then, that the procedures to guarantee the survival of firms allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the judgment handed down last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of foreclosure of their properties in Allende el Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge in the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is bankruptcy filed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the vote between companies, recognized in the critical mass of bankruptcy the debts that Vitro's subsidiaries had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the Courts of the United States, that is, the “vulture” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced starting in 2008, in the face of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country in the face.
For the time being, the firm of the González Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration before the appellate court itself so that the vote reaches its plenary session, that is, the five judges, given that only three voted.
If this does not succeed, the Cerciorare appeal will be sought, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, pointing out that he vented in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambola from two bands: they beat Vitro and they hit the country.
General Balance
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviation Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're looking for Dragon Mart
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for products from the country of the wall, with a suitable housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had succeeded in unifying the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that devastated part of protected areas and poses the mother of all threats against industry.
ACTA died
The government ignored a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already been filed.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility, considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex for the long term

Héctor “Hetin” Reyes: “Basketball has been my life”
Basketball globetrotter Héctor “Hetin” Reyes was linked to the sport of the court for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, he traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as extensive a mental collection of the history of local basketball as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, whether as a player in minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, agent and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I wore a lot of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 90s,” Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes is not exaggerating in making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that indicate his extensive career, attest to this.
Bayamón en el Corazón
Of all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are those that recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th birthday serving as co-agent or agent of the franchise.
“Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-agent or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
From then on, “Cuco” Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over, “Cuco” Ortiz,” Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had managed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: “I have a very strong player for you, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon one championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already a federal boss.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the Olympic Qualifying in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came in fourth place and it should have been bronze if it weren't for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group from the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Championship in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a fight to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world championship.
Not only did that team repeat Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz), but it also had (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter young, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Championship in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended due to the mess of the Pan American Championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That one is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What was left for you to do?
There were things that I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponce will only play in their area and will only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now kids are traveling and playing too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, board officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What do you do now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as “J.R.”, in the television series “Dallas”, in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series “Dallas” became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of “Dallas,” died Friday afternoon due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of “Dallas.”
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he liked the most,” the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I met.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before “Dallas”, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy “I Dream of Jeannie”, broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his house.
He also starred in two comedies that were on the air for a short time, “The Good Life” (NBC, 1971-72) and “Here We Go Again” (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically-acclaimed roles in “The Group”, “Harry and Tonto” and “Primary Colors”.
But it was his masterful portrayal of the enchantingly detestable J.R. that brought Hagman to his greatest stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase “Who shot J.R.?” , designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman was almost murdered, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record viewership at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made “Dallas” the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of “MASH” in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be institutionalized.
“I know what I want on J.R.'s headstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, “Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.”
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone “huge, on and off screen”.
It's unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the episodes for the second season had already finished and a sixth was in progress, the network reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT about how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as “South Pacific” and “Peter Pan”.
Martin was still a teenager when she had it in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir “Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life”.
“I didn't put anything there that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told The Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, such as “don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they'll be fine.”
She was also an activist against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course that explores the “End of the World”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called “Deudarmageddon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end time theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mind.
And he is not the only teacher offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, adjunct professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World”.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We look at why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with real life examples.
“I've tried to inform students about what's possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, entitled only “The End of the World”.
“We didn't add '2012' so we always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin”, students must study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-GPA students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
The fact is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or of the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student studying Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I've never heard of a class that could teach that,” she said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said they believed in the expiration date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and we kind of discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he added that there is apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
“Elsewhere people don't think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any courses on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, “people will immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said that they plan to go to “end of the world” parties.
“Maybe I'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
