First off, I know I said this would be a one part episode, but to quote Tolkien “The tale grew in the telling” and I rather have 2 - 25 ish minutes episodes, than one that is nearly an hour long. Since I’ve already recorded the last one I’ll just have to remain in accurate, but today is just the first half of the story of Aladdin.
The story of Aladdin is a middle east folktale set in China, is not the historical China though, but rather just a land that’s really really far away and exotic, it’s set in China’s capital, though really, it’s just like a medieval middle east kingdom ####.
It has a sultan, most of the people are Muslim and it’s completely plausible that Aladdin was born and raised in China’s capital, has an African uncle from the Barbary coast, chine here is really just “China” in name only so sorry if you were looking for a long in-depth description of medieval China.
Our story starts with Aladdin, a young man being a complete scoundrel, we aren’t giving too much of a description of scoundrelly, but we are told that he doesn’t want to work at all and he just hangs around with his friends all day. This is distressing to his parents, and… yes he has parents in the original telling, his father and mother are tailors, essentially lower middle class small business owners, they worry over Aladdin and his desire is not only to avoid his work as a tailor but avoid any work at all, stresses his father out so much, that he dies.
His mother can’t keep the business open by herself and takes as many small jobs as she can, stitching clothes, as she and her lazy son slide in abject poverty. This continues for a time, until one day a stranger, a renowned African magician chances upon Aladdin screaming and running on the street with his friends, he taps the boy on the shoulder and Aladdin spins around seeing this imposing figure who tells him to stand up; he does, and the magician asks if he is Aladdin the son of the tailor, to which Aladdin tentatively replies that he is. Who wants to know? Before Aladdin can react, the magician pulls him close, hugs him and cries on his neck praising God that he found the boy. They walked the streets of the Chinese capital; Aladdin’s shirt is still wet with the man’s tears and the boy learns that this magician is his uncle who disappeared years ago.
Aladdin and his father weren’t close, so the boy doesn’t know much about his family, the man though, wants to help out as he can, he knows that his brother is dead, but he wants to help out his nephew and raise him from the dreads of society to be a merchant. Something sparks in Aladdin’s mind, he can see himself being someone, actually being respected by his peers and wearing the clothes of a store owner, they apparently were fancy and worthy clothes. His uncle asks Aladdin to ask his mother to have him over for dinner, and Aladdin agrees, they part and the whole way home Aladdin finds himself, for the first time, excited about his life.
At their meager dinner the uncle tells Aladdin’s mom the same story, she can hardly contain her excitement, but the prospect of not having #### and her son by the work of her hands, which are sore from the day of stitching. There are some things that don’t add up though, such as Aladdin’s father never mentioning his brother to his wife or why the man never came to visit until after his brother died. But neither of them really can ignore the possibility of a stable life, not defined by hunger and worry. Also, when the uncle walks in the door, he asks where his brother used to sit at the table, they pointed the spot, and he runs over and kisses the floor which apparently convinces them that he is on the level. The uncle wants to take Aladdin out the next day, to buy him some new clothes so he doesn’t look like such a rodent that lives primarily on the streets, a “street-rat” if you will.
The magician had come in great wealth and only wants to do right by whatever family he has left. They talk late into the night and the uncle leaves. The next morning, Aladdin is overcome with joy by his new merchant’s clothes. The uncle says that he wants to introduce Aladdin to some prominent businessmen who will be meeting just a short distance outside the city in a magnificent garden. The take to the road in late morning and walk for way more than just a short distance. Several hours later, they have walked further than Aladdin has ever walked in his life. They came to rest in a beautiful but empty garden, the uncle bathe , picked some fruit off of a tree and toss it to him , Aladdin devoured it, his uncle had wondered off a bit and was now squatting over a small fire, throwing things on it, and making if flare up, his uncle heard him approach, turned around and smirked, he tossed a powder on the fire and it went out, the air slid aside from 5 feet on either side revealing an alabastro’s lab with a brass ring on it, Aladdin shook, he was stuck in the wilderness with some enchanter, someone who commune with demons, he made to a scape , but found his uncle’s hand like iron pressing on to his wrist. The man held him there, Aladdin pulled and pulled to no avail, his uncle’s sighed, rolled his eyes, reached for his walking stick and cracked Aladdin across the head, Aladdin dropped unconscious in front of him.
When Aladdin woke up, the sun had gone down. He was shivering next to a fire; he looked up and saw his uncle standing over him and with a throbbing head he asked why his uncle had done that. The uncle replied that it was time for Aladdin to be a man, that since the boy’s father was gone, he was his father now and he had complete power over Aladdin. There was silence, Aladdin, who had never left the capital, hadn’t really heard true silence, the night sounds of the city had always been a comfort, and now his first night out of it, he was aware of how quiet his world was, how alone he was out here, with this man he barely knew. “Now”, the uncle continued, “if you are ready to act like a man, I can use your help.” Aladdin knotted and painfully rose to his feet. He followed his uncle to the pit he had opened in the ground, his uncle motioned the alabastros’ slab, and told Aladdin that below was a massive treasure unlike anything all the kings in the earth have.
Aladdin as it turns out is the only who can open the cavern, after he says his parents’ name over it. The gold he would make as a merchant is a pittance to what sits below, and Aladdin needs but go down and get it. The area is divided into three chambers and once Aladdin finds his way to the bottom of the stairs; he would see a room filled with gold. If he touches it, if even the fringes of his robe graced it, he would die. Moving on, he’ll come to magnificent underground garden, with fruits made of precious gemstones, when he passes through that he’ll come to a raised platform with a lamp on it, he needs to take it, dump the oil out of it, and bring it back.
With the lamp in his hand, he can take the fruits or the precious metals on the way out. All the uncle needs, is the old lamp. It seems simple enough, and, since Aladdin didn’t have any other choice, he knotted and made his way to the slab. The uncle stopped him and gave him a ring, telling him that what he had heard was based on half-remembered myths and legends from a world away. So, if Aladdin ran into trouble down there, the ring would help him. Aladdin spoke the name of his parents and a two-foot-thick slab rose easily; the uncle smiled as Aladdin descended into the cavern.
Just in case you’re wondering, there’s no real explanation as to why Aladdin is the chosen hero of destiny, where he and only he can open the cavern. It’s touched on here, but never mentioned again. He’s not from some ancient order of magicians or guardians of the lamp or anything like that, just some poor son of the tailor. I think it would’ve been better to just leave that out. He picked up his robe as he passed the gold and duct around the gemstone fruits before coming to a raised platform with the lamp on it, it was a scuffed and dirty thing and Aladdin didn’t understand why his uncle had come so far for it, but he grabbed it, emptied it and stuffed it into his pack.
On his way out, he hesitated before touching the fruit, took a deep breath and grabbed it, he noticed that he was still alive and stuffed the pack full of gemstones. Walking back through the room with the gold, he scooped up gold and silver into the pack and it dragged on the ground as he came to the stairway. The sun was rising outside as Aladdin came to the stairway, he struggled up all but the last step which was as tall as he was. He told his uncle to help him up, he had the lamp, his uncle shook his head, it was obvious the pack was weighing him down, if Aladdin just passes it up he can easily come out, Aladdin says, “no”, he just needs a hand.
The uncle tells that he can’t help Aladdin and the pack, but if Aladdin just passes the pack, he can take that, then help Aladdin out. Aladdin says he doesn’t see the difference, and they go back and forth a few more times, Aladdin definitely not getting it that his uncle just wants to take the treasure and leave him in the ground. The uncle becomes enraged with Aladdin, who gets equally angry and tells his uncle that “you know what”, once he gets out of here , he’s taking everything with him crampy lamp and all, his uncle clinches his teeth and in his rage he clambered up to the top of the hole and hastily said in temptation , something exploded behind the alabastros slab and it slammed down, leaving Aladdin in darkness, the uncle immediately realized what he did and slid down the bottom of the hole keened up on the brass ring, saying every name he could think of, but nothing happened.
He tried digging to side, but it was solid rock, and tried using magic, but the rock was enchanted as well. The lamp and the only person who could open the cavern to get it was locked underground. He had come so far to find the rub, planning to be his uncle, he even kissed the ground of the hovel they called a house, now it was all for nothing.
The magician quickly gathered up his things, stomped out the fire and headed off to the direction of home. The Bovary Coast, since there was no way he could return to the capital of China, now that the boy was starving to death in the cavern. He left immediately and went back to Africa to do magicians’ stuff. Meanwhile, underground, Aladdin dropped the pack and climbed up, pounding on the slab, it was obvious the man had betrayed him. Hours passed, and Aladdin’s fingers were bloody after crawling at the rocks around the slab, there was no way out. Hours flowed into days, and Aladdin was sure he would starve there. One noon, under the earth.
One night, when the sun had gone down outside, and he was exhausted and freezing he rubbed his hands together to get warm. And accidentally graced the magic ring his false uncle had given him; Aladdin was blinded by the light that fill the cavern. When his eyes adjusted a creature stood in front of him, in the form of a man, yet it appeared to be made out of fire. He told the boy that, because the boy was the owner of the ring, the beam was his slave. The beam, it turns out, is a jinni, I could spend half a podcast talking about the gene, which is plural for jinn, and Jinni actually being spelled “J-I-N-N-I”.
They are supernatural creatures from Islam mythology, they are said to be made out smokeless fire and they can interact with the human world. They come from another universe which is called the Jinnistand. They are considered separate beings from humans and angels, and they are said to have free will, mean they can be from awful-good to chaotic and evil and everything in between. Also, spoiler alert, there’s a jinny in the lamp as well and both of the jinn are considered slaves of whoever robs their respective objects. There are no explanations given to that either.
Oh yes, and these jinn are seemingly inexhaustive supernatural power over our world, though a variant agrees. The jinny and the lamp is said to be much more powerful than the jinny of the ring, but both display an enormous amount of power. These two are called Marid and I know I am not pronouncing that correctly. A Marid is especially large and powerful jinny you can compel him to be your slave through battle, imprisonment, rituals or a great deal of flattery. This just seem natural subservient by nature on being housed on the right terms and unlike certain annotations they sadly don’t make humorous pop culture references from late 20th century America.
"That’s it for our short prime ###; but let me know if you wanna hear more and we can absolutely go for them into more detail.
 Aladdin, who didn’t ask, not only the most obvious of questions but any question at all, gives this creature an order, he said “slave of the ring”, listen to me bring me out of this whole and put me above ground and almost before he finished the sentence he was out, above ground in the sunlight with his gold and jewels."
