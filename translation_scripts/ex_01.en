Okay so the second thing to buy is cheese. They have fresh balls of mozzarella that are really perfect for pizza Fridays, which I know a lot of you guys do. I do as well. It's so fun to make pizza on Friday, or to buy pizza on Friday. But If you make your own, their mozzarella is great. They have lots of Parmesan and Asiago, they have goat cheese, feta cheese and blue cheese, and generally those cheeses are in pretty small containers. So you're not committing to a million pounds of cheese, like you would Costco. Such a great thing to buy at Aldi.
